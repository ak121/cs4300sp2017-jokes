To start off, they don't have a roof to live under, if you don't count the tattered blue tarp that has become synonymous with homelessness, and a universal symbol of despair. It really is a pitiable situation when homeless families keep increasing in size, because the parents lack knowledge of contraception and even if they did, wouldn't be able to afford it without skipping a meal (America, the land of costly healthcare and INR 311.85 condoms), and even if they wanted to, termination of pregnancy was not affordable for them, something eugenics components have been using as an argument in favor of forced sterilization for decades.\n\nThe problems multiply when alcohol and mental instability is introduced to the situation. For instance, an Indo-Hispanic named Rahul Gutierrez moved to America after being fired by Maersk India (a logistics company), for revealing the existence of a confidential blacklist to a blacklisted applicant. Rahul couldn't find a better job in the United States, and soon was evicted by his impatient landlady for not paying his rent for three months in a row. He had three children, Riu, Ree, and Red, all of whom he had named when he was drunk. He blamed Red for his being evicted, as it was Red's birth that made his wife leave him and fall off the grid.\n\nAs such, he treated Red like she wasn't his daughter. Riu and Ree, however, were kindhearted to Red and, considering that they were twins and the family was poor, always got a mutual present for their birthday that they would have to share (and that Red would have to avoid touching at all costs, a rule laid down by their father out of resentment). Before he was evicted, he used the last of his money to buy a small cycle for the twins. However, a month after being evicted, he realized that to ensure survival for the next month, he would have to sell it. \n\nThe twins, being the understanding angels that he had raised them (and only them) to be, they understood, and made no protest. However, they had a request to make. They wanted a last day with the cycle before he could take it to the store. He had enough change to last a day, and let them have their last few hours with it. However, they did not use it. Red was in for a surprise, as the twins took her to the local park and told her to go nuts with it. And for the first time since moving to America, she smiled. She gave a tight hug to her sisters, who were grinning ear to ear the whole time. And for the first and the last time ever, Red used Riu's and Ree's cycle.", "domain": "self.badjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1391354867, "id": "1wt6rn"}, {"title": "Bad Joke of the Day: February 2, 2014", "selftext": "*Knock, knock.*\n\nWho's there?\n\n*To.*\n\nTo who?\n\n*To whom.*", "domain": "self.badjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1391325076, "id": "1wsitl"}, {"title": "What do you call a fish with no eye?", "selftext": "Fsh.", "domain": "self.badjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1391265652, "id": "1wq8hp"}, {"title": "Bad Joke of the Day: February 1, 2014", "selftext": "**Pam:** Coach, can you teach me how to do the splits?\n\n**Gymnastics Coach:** How flexible are you?\n\n**Pam:** I can't do Tuesdays.

So the owner eventually gave up his search and began boarding up the bell tower, leaving the bells to fall silent upon the city of Paris. Just then, a very short, peculiar man with no arms came up to him and said \"Is it too late to audition to be the bell ringer?\"   The owner said \"Well sure you could try out I guess, but how are you going to ring the bells with no arms?\" and the man just gave him a wink and said \"You'll see.\"  So they marched up the 50 flights of stairs to the top of the bell tower. Once at the top the owner said \"Okay, here we are. Lets see what you've got.\"   The man took a few steps back, then broke out into a full sprint at one of the bells. He leapt into the air at one of the bells, hitting it with his face! It made the most beautiful sound the owner had ever heard. EVEN more beautiful than Quasimoto could ever make them sound. So he told the man \"You're hired! You start at dawn tomorrow!\"   \nSo dawn tomorrow comes around. The man climbs up the 50 flights of stairs to the top of the bell tower, takes a few steps back, leaps into the air, and MISSES THE BELL!!  He flies out the window, falling to his death.  After a few moments, a crowd begins to gather around his body in the streets of paris below. There are murmurs of confusion going about the crowd. Nobody knows what just happened.
