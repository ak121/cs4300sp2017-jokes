He can't take any more of him. So he decides to order the yogurt himself, and pay out of his own pocket.

About a month later, it turned out that my girlfriend got pregnant.  Obviously, I had to marry her due to common sense.  I took her out to dinner, and I popped the question.  However, she had said that Joe had raped her, and it wasn't my kid.  I couldn't marry her.  I was furious!  I went back home, threw out all of Joe's shit, ripping his clothes, breaking some shit, too.  As soon as he arrived, I socked him right in the eye, started swelling up like a cottonball.  We exchanged hands-to-cuffs, and I ran into the kitchen to grab a knife.  However, by the time I got back, he had booked it.  Never saw the fucker again.  A couple months later, my friend asked why I was so depressed.  I wouldn't go out anymore, I just stayed home and drink.

It ties you up in knots. Whatever you do, do not let him get you in that hold! If he does, you're finished.\\\" \\n\\nThe Irishman nodded in acknowledgment. As the match started, the Irishman and the Russian circled each other several times, looking for an opening.

A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd and the trainer buried his face in his hands, for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the inevitable happen.\\n\\nSuddenly, there was a long, high pitched scream, then a cheer from the crowd and the trainer raised his eyes just in time to watch the Russian go flying up in the air. His back hit the mat with a thud and the Irishman collapsed on top of him, making the pin and winning the match.\\n\\nThe trainer was astounded. When he finally got his wrestler alone, he asked, \\\"How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!\\\"\\n\\nThe wrestler answered, \\\"Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of testicles right in front of my face. I had nothing to lose so with my last ounce of strength, I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could.\\\"\\n\\nThe trainer exclaimed, \\\"Oh, so that's what finished him off?!!!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not really.

He tells Wilson to come back the next week.\\n\\nThe next week rolls around, and Wilson goes back to see what kind of commercial Gary has put together for him. Gary has Wilson sit down, and pops in a DVD. \\n\\nA scene of the crucifixion of Jesus comes on. He's screaming in agony as a Roman centurion hammers away at his wrists. The Roman stops, turns to the camera, smiles and says \\\"You always know you're doing the job right when you use Wilson nails!\\\"\\n\\nWilson is less than thrilled. He explains to Gary that he's uncomfortable with his nails being driven into the body of Christ. Gary understands completely, and asks Wilson to come back next week to see another commercial. Wilson agrees.\\n\\nNext week comes, and Wilson meets up with Gary again. Gary pops in another DVD and the scene begins. It's exactly the same as the last commercial, with the difference being that now there are small pieces of wood covering the wrists where the nails are piercing Jesus. The Roman stops his hammering, turns to the camera, smiles and says \\\"You always know you're doing the job right when you use Wilson nails!\\\"\\n\\nWilson is irate. He yells at Gary, accusing him of trying to run him out of business. Gary manages to calm Wilson down, and begs for another chance. Reluctantly, Wilson agrees, and they set up a meeting for next week.\\n\\nWilson shows up to the meeting expecting to be disappointed, despite Gary's assurances that this time everything will be fine. Gary pops in a DVD and the scene begins. It's a beautiful desert scene, the blue sky merging perfectly with the rolling dunes. Suddenly, a naked, bearded man comes running from off screen, being followed closely by a pack of Roman centurions. The camera pans in on the group, and one of them, sweating and panting says sadly, \\\"I guess we should have used Wilson nails.\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"Wilson Nails\",\n        \"upvotes\": 14\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5wzibf\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"\\\"How would you like your disciples?\\\" \\nMohammad replies \\\"Beautiful!\\\" which he gets the answer \\\"Sorry, man Jesus took them all.\\\"\\n\\nMohammad thinks for a while and says \\\"I want them to be very intelligent, then.\\\" \\nFeeling sorry for him, God answers \\\"Those are called dibs by Moses.\\\"\\n\\nFeeling really frustrated, Mohammad shouts\\n\\nTHEN I WANT THEM FUCKING COVERED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"God asks Mohammad\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5wzgnr\",\n        \"num_comments\": 1,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"\\\"Yeah.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It states that whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.

I'd definitely prefer jokes longer than just set-up: punchline, thank you all in advance!\\n\\nTOPICS:\\n\\nLight\\n\\nDarkness\\n\\nHoney/Bee/Sting\\n\\nHot/Cold\\n\\nTime\\n\\nMountain\\n\\nToday\\n\\nTomorrow\\n\\nSeize the Day\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ucq2\",\n        \"title\": \"Requesting jokes on specific topics (Mod-approved)\",\n        \"upvotes\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.cleanjokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"53mzqk\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"What do you call an Italian romance novel model who's let himself go?\\n\\nFlabio.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ucq2\",\n        \"title\": \"What do you call...\",\n        \"upvotes\": 28\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.cleanjokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"53jhby\",\n        \"num_comments\": 2,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"He was delighted.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ucq2\",\n        \"title\": \"How did the desk lamp store manager feel when thieves stole all his lightbulbs?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 37\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.cleanjokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"53j04u\",\n        \"num_comments\": 5,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"You think it's the \\\"R\\\" but it's really the \\\"C\\\".\\n\\nHappy talk like a pirate day!\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ucq2\",\n        \"title\": \"What's a pirates favorite letter?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 17\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.cleanjokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"53l5gc\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"All I said was that he made too many mistakes...\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ucq2\",\n        \"title\": \"A vampire stopped coming to my nightly poker games.\",\n        \"upvotes\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.cleanjokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"53gdth\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"A child asked his father, \\\"How were people born?\\\" So his father said, \\\"Adam and Eve made babies, then their babies became adults and made babies, and so on.\\\" The child then went to his mother, asked her the same question and she told him, \\\"We were monkeys then we evolved to become like we are now.\\\" The child ran back to his father and said, \\\"You lied to me!\\\" His father replied, \\\"No, your mom was talking about her side of the family.\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ucq2\",\n        \"title\": \"Two sides of a picture -

Confused, the townsfolk got out of bed and traced the sound to the nearby Tyne river, where they spotted something incredible - an enormous frog, possibly the largest ever, sitting on a huge lily pad. At first, the townsfolk wanted to get rid of the frog, as its loud croaking would soon drive everyone crazy. But since it was just so uncommonly large, they all agreed to keep it as a tourist attraction instead.\\n\\nHowever, after a day of endless croaking and a sleepless night for all of Clara Vale, the town knew that they just had to get rid of it. Unfortunately though, every time someone attempted to capture the frog, it would hop into the water, only to return to its lily pad and resume its loud croaking not long after.\\n\\nAfter many days of incessant croaking, a person decided to dive into the river and capture the frog that way; unfortunately the frog was just way too fast. However, just before the diver gave up, he noticed something sitting at the bottom of the river - a collar with an address tag on it!\\n\\nThe diver handed in the collar to the local police, and, after they inspected it, they knew that it must have been attached the frog. The police drove to the address on the collar's tag and knocked on the house door.

So he stands in the limo line, and finally gets up there to rent a limo. All that's left is to get her a corsage, so he heads to the florist. When he gets there... wouldn't you know it, another line. So the boy stands in the florist line... finally he gets up to pick out the perfect corsage.\\n\\nThe big day finally arrives, and the boy gets ready. He's got his tux on, the corsage ready to go, and the limo standing by to pick them up. So, he goes to her place to pick her up, and she is stunningly beautiful.

There's a line to get in the prom.

Please don't hesitate to throw these post op instructions in the nearest waste receptacle. \\n\\nPOST-OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS FOR LAPAROSCOPY\\r\\n\\nLaparoscopic surgery may be performed for the diagnosis of pelvic pain, for evaluation of uterine or ovarian masses, for management of ectopic (tubal) pregnancy, to locate lost keys, for tubal sterilization, or for removal of an ovary or ovarian\\rcyst.\\r\\n\\nYou may feel some chest, shoulder or abdominal discomfort for a few days. This discomfort is a result of the \\r\\nHydrogen gas that was introduced in the abdomen during surgery. Your body will absorb this gas after 24 to 48 hours and over the next few days you will produce a series of violent and unexpected farts. For relief, you may apply heat to your abdomen or lay flat. Under no circumstances should you go near to a flame source! (Much blood, many deaths)\\n\\nIt is important to take a stool softener such as Dynamite while taking narcotic pain medication such as Percocet \\r\\nor Vicodin. Please purchase a stool softener before your surgery. In addition it would be wise to line the walls of \\r\\nyour bathroom with non-stick material in case of an accidental overdose of the stool softener.\\r\\n\\nYou may take \\u201cover the counter\\u201d pain relievers that do not contain aspirin such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or \\r\\nibuprofen (Motrin or Advil). Do not exceed the daily recommended dose.\\r\\nNote: If the pain is not relieved by pain medication, becomes worse, or you have difficulty breathing, call our office.\\r\\n\\nLaparoscopic incisions are closed with skin adhesive which may have a bluish/shiny appearance on the skin and/or with subcutaneous (under the skin) suture.\\r\\nInspect your incisions daily. Try not to faint or vomit.\\r\\n\\nA large amount of blood or clear drainage from the incisions is normal and not a cause for concern.\\r\\n\\nBruising around your incision sites is common and a cause for concern.\\r\\nYour incisions may be itchy for a few days. This is part of the normal healing process.\\r\\n\\nAs your incisions heal, they will change in color and may become numb for several weeks.\\n\\nIf you have small dressings or Band-Aids, they may be removed in 24 hours.\\r\\n\\nIf you have steri-strips (small adhesive strips) in place, they will peel and fall off. If they do not fall off in 10 \\r\\ndays, carefully peel them off.\\r\\n\\nIf you have stitches, they will dissolve on their own.\\r\\n\\nIf you have none of the above your surgeon had one too many sherbets at the club and has forgotten to close the \\r\\nwounds. \\r\\n\\nNote: If you notice any redness, heavy drainage, your bum falls off, or bleeding from your incisions, call our office.\\r\\n\\nYou may resume the diet you had prior to surgery if you are brave.\\r\\n\\nDrink 600-800 glasses of fizzy pop daily and then bounce vigorously on a trampoline. (We have always \\r\\nwondered what would happen.)\\r\\n\\nFor the first several days after surgery, the bowel is usually less active. You may not have a regular bowel movement right away depending on pre-op bowel prep or pain medication use. \\n\\nIf, after six months you have not had a decent crap, you may have a problem. This usually proves to be as a result of your surgeon forgetting the purpose of the procedure and deciding that all that stuff in there looked disgusting and removed it. Sadly you will have to snake a garden hose up your clacka as a makeshift replacement for your bowel.\\r\\n\\nNarcotic pain medication (Percocet, Vicodin, Selleys Stop Leak, building putty, hydrocodone or oxycodone) \\r\\nwill increase constipation.\\r\\n\\nBowel movements will be deceptively violent and it would be best to wear a wetsuit with the butt removed at all \\r\\ntimes until regular motions return.\\r\\n\\nIf constipation should occur:\\r\\n\\n\\uf0b7 Drink more fluids\\r\\n\\n\\uf0b7 Continue to take a stool softener such as dynamite until constipation resolves\\r\\n\\n\\uf0b7 Take a mild laxative such as Bob\\u2019s Mega Poo.\\r\\n\\nMild abdominal swelling can occur following surgery due to removal of the bowels and hydrogen gas used to \\r\\ndistend the abdomen during surgery and as a source of childish amusement for the operating room staff.\\r\\n\\nSwelling of the head and lower extremities is common due to fluids given during surgery.\\r\\n\\nSwelling of the face can occur due to positioning during surgery.\\n\\nIf you have swelling of the calves that is persistent or associated with redness, call our office.\\r\\n\\nIt is normal to feel tired for a few days after surgery. Listen to the voices in your head and do not overdo it.\\r\\n\\nWeight lifting is encouraged immediately after surgery, as tolerated. You should NOT be bedridden after surgery as continued movement will prevent prolonged recovery times due to \\u201cblobbage.\\u201d\\r\\n\\nIf you could climb stairs un-aided prior to surgery you are a show off.\\r\\n\\nIf your incisions are 5 millimeters (the width of a pencil), you may resume your normal activities and exercise \\r\\nregimen after two weeks.\\r\\n\\nIf your incisions are 10 millimeters (finger width) or larger, you should avoid strenuous activities such as heavy \\r\\nlifting (greater than 10 pounds or a gallon of milk), pushing or pulling for six weeks.\\r\\n\\nDo not drive while taking prescription pain medication or if your level of discomfort could inhibit your ability to \\r\\noperate a motor vehicle safely.\\r\\n\\nMost patients are able to return to work after two minutes. Recovery times vary from patient to patient. Your \\r\\ndoctor will make recommendations based on your level of woosiness.\\r\\n\\nYou may shower the day after surgery. Pat incisions dry. Do not rub incisions with washcloth or towel but use \\r\\nsteel wool. Keep your incisions as moist as possible.\\r\\n\\nYou will need a bath after six weeks as everyone will tell you. You must also wait six weeks to go into a swimming pool, hot tub, or the ocean. Indeed with the abdominal swelling you may be mistaken for a hump back and harpooned.\\r\\n\\nSurgery can alter your menstrual cycles. Your first cycle should have training wheels and a little bell, and could occur early or late. Your guess is as good as ours. If your cycle is more than seven days late, you should take a home pregnancy test if you have been \\u2018doing the naughty.\\u2019\\r\\n\\nYou should schedule a follow-up post-operative appointment at two weeks and at six weeks.\\r\\n\\n\\uf0b7 A fever higher than 600.4 degrees C\\r\\n\\n\\uf0b7 Increasing pain not controlled by pain medication\\r\\n\\n\\uf0b7 Inability to eat or drink without vomiting\\r\\n\\n\\uf0b7 Shortness of breath\\r\\n\\n\\uf0b7 Inability to empty your bladder with urine squirting from your ears.\\r\\n\\n\\uf0b7 Redness and tenderness at the incision site, or a large amount of drainage\\r\\n\\n\\uf0b7 Heavy, bright red critter tearing its way out of your belly. \\n\\nYou can expect to have small reddish-brown colored feet for up to two weeks. Do not be alarmed by this.\\n\\nIf you feel you need to be seen urgently, please go to a different hospital where your surgery was not performed \\r\\nas our physicians have been fired for being drunk and insane whilst operating.\\r\\nAny questions regarding your surgery or post-operative recovery should be googled. It would be pointless to ask the staff at the Women\\u2019s Clinic Southern Piddle or your Primary Care Physician as they only in it for the money and are not penalized in any way if one of their victims should drop off the perch.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ucq2\",\n        \"title\": \"Can you find the embellishments?\",\n

He is then eventually taken to hospital.\\n\\nThere is one man left at the bar, the bartender and the guy goes up to him and says, \\\"Want to hear my joke, it's the funniest joke ever made and I will tell you it for just \\u00a310, then I'm off.\\\"\\nAnd the man responds, \\\"No, because then there will be no one left to call in the ambulance!\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ucq2\",\n        \"title\": \"The Worlds Funniest Joke\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.cleanjokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2zgftc\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Three men are walking in the desert and they each brought an item with them.

They soon became best friends for life, eventually joining the army together, saving each others lives several times. After the army, they each married, and their wives soon became best friends too. They stayed together, moving to the same city and even getting houses next door to one another. They were regularly over at one anothers house, all of that jazz.\\n\\nOne day, when they were old and grey, they all went shopping, as they did rather regularly. The men, also as per their custom, would occasionally stop shopping and sit on a nearby park bench until the wives came out of the shop, telling dirty jokes to one another and generally being ornery. The bench they chose today was across the street from the shop, so they had a great view of the door for when the wives got done shopping.\\n\\nAfter a while, they see something up the hill, headed down the street towards them. Someone was recklessly rollerblading down the street, and as the man got closer it became clear he was high on drugs and had no sense of reality. Just then, the wives open the door and start walking out. Thinking fast, Mortimer throws his cane in front of the man, hoping to trip him up and stop him before he ran into the wives. Unfortunately it sent him flying and he still hit the women, killing them instantly.\\n\\nSteve looks at the tragedy before him. Being a smart-Alec, he then says to his friend, \\\"Well, Morty. Looks like you just killed our two old birds with one stoner.\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ucq2\",\n        \"title\": \"A story about old friends\",\n        \"upvotes\": 31\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.cleanjokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2xtgt5\",\n        \"num_comments\": 7,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"The sharks life lacked porpoise.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ucq2\",\n        \"title\": \"Why was the dolphin happy and the shark depressed?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 72\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.cleanjokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2xsrz3\",\n        \"num_comments\": 2,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"There once was a rural veterinarian who hated his job. One day, he got a call from a rancher who said that one of his horses was having trouble eating and that he suspected an infected tooth. Reluctantly, he went out to the ranch and began inspecting the horse. The rancher had other work to do so he left the vet alone with the horse. The vet, mumbling to himself, looked at the horse and said \\\"I don't suppose I can get you to forget the whole thing and just split the rancher's money with me 50/50?\\\" Much to his surprise, the horse replied and agreed to his plan. Baffled, but still wanting to get out of the smelly work, he promised the horse to return in a week with the money.  A week went by, and the vet decided to keep all the money for himself. \\\"After all,\\\" he thought \\\"what use does a horse have for money?\\\" Another week passed and the rancher called the vet, very upset. \\\"My horse has stopped eating again! You must not have done a thorough job. I want you to come back out and fix the problem, and I'm not paying for it this time.\\\"  The vet had no choice. Regretting his mistakes, he decided to take along the cash to bribe the horse with, but he brought only $20 in small bills, assuming the horse couldn't count.  When he arrived, the rancher insisted on supervising the examination. The vet approached the horse and gave a discreet nod, motioning to the wad of bills in his hand which he dropped in the corner of the stall.  Thinking the worst was over, the vet began to inspect the horse's tooth in earnest. Once the vet's hand was fully inside his jaw, the horse clamped down--mangling his wrist and breaking several bones.  And that, my friends, is why you should never look a stiffed horse in the mouth.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ucq2\",\n

But if they\\nsubtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer.\\n\\nSo, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by a higher percentage the poorer he was, to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using, and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay.\\n\\nAnd so the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% saving).\\n\\nThe sixth now paid \\u00a32 instead of \\u00a33 (33% saving).\\n\\nThe seventh now paid \\u00a35 instead of \\u00a37 (28% saving).\\nThe eighth now paid \\u00a39 instead of \\u00a312 (25% saving).\\n\\nThe ninth now paid \\u00a314 instead of \\u00a318 (22% saving).\\n\\nThe tenth now paid \\u00a349 instead of \\u00a359 (16% saving).\\n\\nEach of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings.\\n\\n\\\"I only got a pound out of the \\u00a320 saving,\\\" declared the sixth man.\\n\\nHe pointed to the tenth man,\\\"but he got \\u00a310!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yeah, that's right,\\\" exclaimed the fifth man. \\\"I only saved a pound too. It's unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's true!\\\" shouted the seventh man. \\\"Why should he get \\u00a310 back, when I got only \\u00a32? The wealthy get all the breaks!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wait a minute,\\\" yelled the first four men in unison, \\\"we didn't get anything at all.

Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, 'I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.'\\n\\nI said, 'WHAT??!! What was that?!'\\n\\nSo she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear... \\n\\n'You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.' \\n\\nShe responded to my puzzled look by saying, 'Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?' \\n\\nRealizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep. \\n\\nThe very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, 'Lets get a pair for each outfit.' \\n\\nWe went on to the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. \\n\\nI think I threw her for a loop when I said, 'That's fine, honey.' She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, 'I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier.' \\n\\nI could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, 'No honey, I don't feel like it.'\\n\\nHer face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, 'WHAT?' \\n\\nI then said, 'Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.' \\n\\nAnd just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, 'Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?' \\n\\nApparently I'm not having sex tonight.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"Not having sex tonight\",\n        \"upvotes\": 1733\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"4iumvg\",\n        \"num_comments\": 725,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"A boy asks his dad \\\"Why do they say gardeners have green thumbs,when their thumbs are not green?\\\"\\n\\nThe dad replies,\\\"It's just a saying son,It's like when somebody is caught stealing,they say they have been caught 'red handed',even though their hands is black.\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"A boy asks his dad a question\",\n        \"upvotes\": 7524\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"3e7mfw\",\n        \"num_comments\": 19,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"https://i.imgur.com/txMwWBX.jpg\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"What do you call a rich Chinese?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 22\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"4aqmcn\",\n        \"num_comments\": 23,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"It doesn't happen.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"Up votes are a bit like my sex life.\",\n        \"upvotes\": 10\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"1ikff8\",\n        \"num_comments\": 3,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"They tell you the minute you meet them\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"How can you tell if a person is vegan\",\n        \"upvotes\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"wcsz4\",\n        \"num_comments\": 4,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"He drank his coffee before it was cool. \",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"How did the hipster burn his mouth?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"4sqjj7\",\n        \"num_comments\": 12,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"\\\"Are you kidding?

Therefore 2 + 2 is less than 100'.\\nThey finally pose the problem to the mathematician, and he pulls out this notebook and starts scribbling. 30 minutes later, he looks up the panel and triumphantly declares, 'It converges!!!'\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"An engineer, physicist and mathematician are in an interview (with no accountants) ...\",\n        \"upvotes\": 12\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2ves3v\",\n        \"num_comments\": 13,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Made you click.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"I can control what you do next in life.\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"ocdb9\",\n        \"num_comments\": 5,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Man walks into a bar, with an alligator in hand, and has a seat.\\n\\nHe says to the crowd, \\\"I bet everyone in here 1 beer, that I won't stick my dick into his mouth\\\".

I went into our apartment building and up to the 29th floor where we live, and I burst through the door and headed towards our bedroom. I could hear some noises being made, but by the time I flung open our bedroom door all I saw was my naked and sweaty wife. I started screaming at her and I tore open the closet doors and looked under the bed, but I couldn\\u2019t find anyone else. I was just about to give up when I suddenly heard a noise out on our balcony. I went out there and sure enough, there was a naked guy dangling from our ledge, 29 stories up. I was so mad that I started punching and kicking him, but he held on so I went back inside, grabbed a hammer, and smashed his fingers. He let go and plunged down all 29 flights, but the lucky sonofab*tch managed to hit the awning outside our building and bounce into the bushes. At this point I was so mad that I rushed into our kitchen, ripped the refrigerator out of the wall, dragged it onto the balcony and threw it down on top of him. It did the trick, but all that exertion got to me and I had a massive heart attack, and well, here I am.\\u201d\\n\\nSt. Peter says, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s a hard luck story all right. Go ahead and go on in.\\u201d\\n\\nThe next guy comes to the line and St. Peter says, \\u201cOK, give me your hard luck story.\\u201d\\n\\nThe guy tells him:\\n\\n\\u201cWell, I live on the 30th floor of an apartment building and I like to sunbathe nude on my balcony in the afternoon. I was out there today catching some rays when I suddenly heard a great commotion going on one floor below. I went to the end of my balcony and peered down over the railing, but I slipped and tumbled over it and started to fall down. Luckily, I managed to catch myself on the ledge one floor below, and suddenly a guy came out. I figured he would help me, but instead he starts punching and kicking me. I held on with all my might, but he eventually got a hammer and smashed my fingers, so I let go and fell down to the bottom. I must have hit our building\\u2019s awning and bounced into the bushes, by the grace of god I was still alive!

She found that he currently already had an outstanding loan which he hadn't even begun to pay off, and she therefore wasn't allowed to give him another one. After explaining this to the frog, the frog said: \\\"Come on darling, my dad's Mick Jagger! I need the money to fly out to England to go see him!\\\".\\n\\nSadly, Patricia had to explain that this wasn't a valid reason to warrant a loan, and that she woudn't be able to help him until he paid back his other outstanding loan. Hearing this, the frog pulled out a small keychain trinket, and slid it across the desk to Patricia with a wink. \\\"Here. Now can I get my loan?\\\" he whispered.\\n\\nOutraged at this brazen attempt to bribe her, Patricia called in the bank manager. After hearing both sides of the story, the manager decided that the bribe wasn't really that outrageous, and decided to help out the frog. He explained to Patricia that she was being silly, and that helping out the frog would be the right thing to do.\\n\\nTL;DR: It's just a knick-knack Patty Mac, give the frog a loan, his old man's a Rolling Stone.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"There once was a teller at a bank...\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"y1ond\",\n        \"num_comments\": 4,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"2 jews fighting over a penny\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"How was copper wire invented???\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"nyfky\",\n        \"num_comments\": 3,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Mine's 1920x1080.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"What's your new years resolution?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"4geq6n\",\n        \"num_comments\": 350,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"They know my name isnt Someone Help\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"I hate when a girl says the wrong name during sex\",\n        \"upvotes\": 5828\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"25baqw\",\n        \"num_comments\": 33,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"the little girl is playing in the grass.

She finally crosses the finish line in just under 10 minutes. \\\"Aha, that must be some kind of record!\\\" she exclaims.\\n\\\"I don't think so,\\\" says Obama, \\\"Bush did 9:11\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"It's the end of the 2016 Presidential race...\",\n        \"upvotes\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"4dhyno\",\n        \"num_comments\": 7,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Because blacks have no rights \",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"Why is Obama left-handed?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"1xdxaz\",\n        \"num_comments\": 2,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Girl: What's up ?\\n\\nBoy: If I tell you, will you sit on it ?\",\n        \"over_18\": true,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"Girl to boy.\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"1nuudi\",\n        \"num_comments\": 3,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"A pizza can feed a family of four.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"What's the difference between a black guy and a pizza?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"1exxua\",\n        \"num_comments\": 3,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Ape-ril\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"What month was King Kong born in?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"17rsca\",\n        \"num_comments\": 2,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"are walking through a park together.

I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.\\n\\nAnyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.\\n\\nI don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).\\n\\nSooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.\\n\\nMy friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.\\n\\nAfter we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging.\\nPretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.\\n\\nMy friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.\\n\\nSadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.\\n\\nBut I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.\\n\\nA little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised.\\nBut even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.\\n\\nIt was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.\",\n        \"upvotes\": 2325\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"46f02h\",\n        \"num_comments\": 17,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"One is very heavy and the other is a little lighter. \",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"What's the difference between a hippo and a zippo?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 26\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"55wh94\",\n        \"num_comments\": 10,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"A man in his early thirties walks into a pharmacy, gets to the counter and asks for the \\\"morning after\\\" pills, explaining that he needs them for his daughter.

Five minutes pass and nothing is going on, but then a small man appears, takes a seat on this chair, looks around, sees noone and starts jerking off furiously.\\n\\nFive minutes pass, he's still masturbating, ten minutes pass... Twenty minutes pass and everyone's still dead quiet.

I figured it out when I was about 13, and since then I've never really been attracted to boys at all. I've never ever been interested in boys or having a relationship with one. I have many guy friends, but I've never been sexually attracted to any of them in any sense of the word, or any male really.\\n\\n I've always been attracted to women. I'd walk down the street, I'd see a woman, and I'd in my head imagine being with her for a night. I'm really shy about it, and I never talk about sexuality in open, except with my partner, since I'm really, really shy about it. But I am a very sexual person towards women, I think about almost every woman I come in contact with who is moderately attractive. I was in a relationship with a girl for the past 5 years. I really loved her, I thought we were going to be together forever, I really did. Over the past year things started to get bumpy, and she really began changing.\\n\\n\\nHer personality changed and she wasn't the girl I fell in love with. She was sometimes becoming really violent and abusive, and the next day would be very meek and apologetic, and then would go back to being angry. I couldn't deal with her anymore, it reached a certain point where I felt... I just didn't care for her anymore as a person. This was going on for a year so when we decided to break up, it was so clear this was what had to happen. She wanted to still 'stay friends'. I was struggling to hold back the tears, but many came through.\\n\\n\\n I refused, I said no, it was over, no friends, no nothing, we're through. She got angry, said some really nasty things, I got scared a little, but then it was over. I was just left with my tears. The next few days were terrible, I would spend a lot of the time crying. And this is when it happened. I have one friend, he's really close, he's probably one of my best friends. He's a straight guy, but he's also 22, so he's much younger than me. He knows I'm lesbian and has always been there for me, we've known each other for maybe 2 years, 2 and a half years. We haven't known each other that long, but our friendship flourished from the get-go. \\n\\n\\nThere was never any romantic tension or sexual sparks between us, he knew I was strictly into women and respected that. We were together at my home, we were talking. When I say we, it was mostly me. I was just going on and on about her, and what she meant to me, and how she hurt me. He kept reassuring me that I did the right decision because she was becoming borderline abusive, but I had convinced myself that I still loved her. He was telling me I shouldn't do this to myself, and I deserve much better. I was the one who initiated it, it was all me. I don't know what came over me. \\n\\n\\nHe was sitting on the couch, and I pressed forward with him, trying to come on to him, trying to kiss him. He was at first resistant and was unsure of what I was doing, he said \\\"what are you doing\\\" \\\"are you sure, you want this.\\\" I told him \\\"please, this is what I want\\\", and then he went with it too. I then led him up to the bedroom in my house, things started getting heated and suddenly he asked for some money! I quickly looked again and realized he was an extinct reptile from the Mesozoic era and I was like \\\"Damnit Loch Ness monster!

The phone call he had received three days earlier kept replaying in his mind over and over again.\\n\\nShe was out of town for a press conference. \\u201cI can\\u2019t not go, honey. I was the lead designer for the prototype. Who else is going to announce and describe its features?\\u201d \\n\\nAdam never became too involved in Alexa\\u2019s career. He was supportive, but the amount of time she spent away from home was anything but enjoyable for Adam.\\n\\n Adam was a retired homicide investigator, though his retirement was earlier than he\\u2019d have preferred. He\\u2019d known it would happen if he kept pursuing the case, but a double homicide on two children under the age of 10 was too much for Adam to just \\u201clet go.\\u201d During his investigation, he got in a bad way with some worse people and became too much of a liability for the department. Retirement was the only option. \\n\\nThe phone call though\\u2026 the phone call changed everything. Alexa\\u2019s assistant was in tears as she told him. Adam couldn\\u2019t suppress his despair when he found out his beloved wife was found with a gun in her hand and a bullet through her head in the company paid hotel suite: Suite 103. \\n\\nAdam was waiting. He was told that his arrest was inevitable if he interfered with the investigation. That wouldn\\u2019t stop him from conducting his own once the unmotivated machine-men finished lazily going through their procedures. \\n\\n\\nHe arrived the next day at the hotel, and his hangover disappeared as soon as he walked through the doors. The hotel manager seemed to be giving him looks of disapproval as soon as he walked through the door, so unsurprisingly, he refused to allow Adam into Suite 103 since the investigation was over and had already deemed the death a suicide. \\n\\n\\nAdam knew Alexa better than that. This wasn\\u2019t a suicide no matter what the investigation seemed to reveal, and no bitter hotel manager with a big nose and a bigger stick up his ass would keep Adam from finding out what really happened in that hotel suite.\\n\\n Adam headed into a maintenance hallway and began watching the workers. They seemed to still be talking about the incident in Suite 103. Adam noticed one girl in particular: a blonde, around 22 years of age who he knew would have a wonderful smile if she allowed one to occupy her face. A smile seemed out of the question for her, though. She seemed to feel more uncomfortable talking about the \\u201csuicide\\u201d than the other workers, and upon learning she worked with the housekeeping staff, Adam knew she was his way in. \\n\\n\\nHe waited for her to enter the restroom and seated himself close enough for her to notice him when she walked out, but far enough away to be covert about it. Thinking about Alexa was all Adam needed for tears to begin streaming down his face. The blonde exited the restroom and stared at him for a bit before approaching him. \\n\\n\\n\\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d whispered the girl. \\n\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ve had better days.\\u201d Stuttered Adam.\\n\\nWhile explaining his situation, Adam learned the girl\\u2019s name was Alex\\u2014a convenient coincidence as far as Adam was concerned. Alex had tears glistening in her eyes by the time Adam was finished, and it was not difficult to convince her to help him.\\n\\n\\nThere were three conditions Adam had to follow if he wanted to have access to Suite 103: \\n\\n1. He had to make his own copy of the key to the room. \\n\\n2. Alex\\u2019s involvement in helping him had to remain a secret no matter what. \\n\\n3. Adam had to only access the suite at evenfall for around half an hour each day, as that was the latest time he could enter without seeming suspicious, and shift changes of security personnel lasted around that long. \\n\\nAdam\\u2019s first day in the suite didn\\u2019t yield much. He noticed the bullet hole in the wall didn\\u2019t make much sense with what he expected based on evidence from Alexa\\u2019s head, but that was all speculation since Adam didn\\u2019t get to observe the initial investigation.\\n\\n\\nOver a period of nine days, Adam visited Suite 103 each day for a half hour. He noticed nothing that the investigation hadn\\u2019t already revealed. He went home on day nine and thought that maybe he didn\\u2019t know his wife as well as he thought he did. He tried to convince himself that his efforts weren\\u2019t all for naught, but nothing seemed to support that idea. \\n\\n\\nAs he was drowning in those depressing thoughts, he realized that there was one thing he hadn\\u2019t looked at. Investigators avoid searching sheets and any other form of fabric for fingerprints because the material does not hold the prints like a glossy and hard surface does; however, that hotel room had a blanket over the comforter on the bed that was mainly there for aesthetic appeal. This blanket had some sort of glossy coating on it from what Adam had observed when he removed it from the bed on day one. If there were one place from which someone wouldn\\u2019t think to clean their fingerprints, that place would be on a blanket. \\n\\n\\nAdam couldn\\u2019t wait for the next night. He grabbed his supplies for revealing prints and his key to the suite and rushed back to the hotel. He hurried through the doors and saw Alex whose eyes widened upon seeing him. She vigorously shook her head, but Adam ignored it and jogged to the suite, opening the door and entering. He began applying a powdery residue to the glossy blanket. \\n\\n\\nThe door swung open and the hotel manager\\u2019s silhouette came into view on the mirror in front of the door. \\n\\n\\n\\u201cGET OUT!\\u201d he screamed. \\n\\n\\nAdam knew he wouldn\\u2019t be able to reason with the hotel manager, so he just kept searching the blanket for fingerprints. Adam worked through the hotel manager calling the police and worked through the hotel manager\\u2019s constant screaming. Sure enough, the blanket was covered in prints. Prints from multiple people. Prints from more people than were involved in his wife\\u2019s death, but Adam knew that some of them belonged to her killer. \\n\\n\\nSeconds after this revelation, Adam\\u2019s arm was grasped firmly and he was handcuffed and brought to his feet. \\n\\n\\n\\u201cNO! My wife was killed! Murdered! The killer\\u2019s prints are on that sheet! I know it!\\u201d \\n\\n\\nThe officers would not listen and they led Adam to the doorway. Adam walked away from his life and left his heart on that blanket. As the hotel room door closed, Adam turned back toward the room as a single tear streamed down his cheek. Emotion overwhelmed his voice as he opened his mouth and whispered, \\u201cGood night, suite prints.\\u201d\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"Suite 103\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"19ra4v\",\n        \"num_comments\": 4,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"You fuck her. \",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"How do you get a nun pregnant?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"15fw5c\",\n        \"num_comments\": 4,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"You won't find a Lambo in a landfill.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"What's the difference between 100 dead babies and a Lamborghini?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"yjudm\",\n        \"num_comments\": 3,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"The WNBA.\",\n        \"upvotes\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"xne79\",\n        \"num_comments\": 5,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"...And hating to see good food go to waste, I decided to have the soup as well.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"I decided to have a can of soup for lunch today...\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"sr0zy\",\n        \"num_comments\": 3,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"http://i.imgur.com/qObbl.jpg\\n\\nI took my dad to the mall the other day to buy some new shoes (he is 66).

He caps it tightly, shakes it up to mix it thoroughly, and takes it to the doctor in the morning.\\n\\nThe doctor takes the cup into his office, and returns a few minutes later with a stack of printouts and a grim expression. \\\"Give it to me straight, doc,\\\" the guy says, barely able to contain a smile. \\\"What does your computer say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bad news, I'm afraid,\\\" says the doctor. \\\"Your wife is screwing the mailman, you daughter has the clap, your dog has heartworm, your car is about to throw a rod, and if you don't stop jacking off, your tennis elbow is never going to get any better.\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"Tennis Elbow\",\n        \"upvotes\": 10\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2thg42\",\n        \"num_comments\": 203,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"A teenage boy is getting ready to take his girlfriend to the prom.

Disguised Jesus thinks to himself \\\"Fuck it..  I'm on vacation\\\" and lights it up and takes a big toke.  Jesus is enjoying the buzz and is reflecting on how nice this trucker has been to him when it occurs to him that he hasn't even introduced himself.

If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.\\n\\n\\nRule Three:\\n\\nI am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose his compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, in order to ensure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place to your waist.\\n\\n\\nRule Four:\\n\\nI'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a \\\"barrier method\\\" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate, when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.\\n\\n\\nRule Five:\\n\\nIt is usually understood that in order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this.

This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make you cry.\\n\\n\\nRule Seven:\\n\\nAs you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process that can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?\\n\\n\\nRule Eight:\\n\\nThe following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka - zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which features chain saws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.\\n\\nRule Nine:\\n\\nDo not lie to me. I may appear to be a potbellied, balding, middle-aged, dimwitted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless god of your universe. If I ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle with me.\\n\\nRule Ten:\\n\\nBe afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy near Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveway you should exit your car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your car - there is no need for you to come inside.

Therefore, it follows that God has the greatest P-ness in reality. \",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"De Phallum Dei\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"1vqvjk\",\n        \"num_comments\": 3,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Because two Wongs don't make a white\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"Why can't two Chinese people make a white baby?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"1h10wt\",\n        \"num_comments\": 4,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"a stick\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"What is brown and sticky?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"1gi4el\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Because they always see widescreen!\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"Why dont Asians go to the theaters?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"1eznkv\",\n        \"num_comments\": 1,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"None.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"How many potatoes does it take to kill an Irishman?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"1e55xe\",\n        \"num_comments\": 1,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"A homesick abortion.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"What's red and crawls up your leg?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"1dd0o7\",\n        \"num_comments\": 4,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"They're all easy to do decent but hard to do great. \",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"What do sex, Mexican food, and pizza have in common?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"vsh7l\",\n        \"num_comments\": 5,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"The Library\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qh72\",\n        \"title\": \"What's the most dishonest place on earth?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.Jokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"sq94k\",\n        \"num_comments\": 3,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"An octopus walks into a pub and says \\\"I can play ANY musical instrument going.\\\"An Englishman gives him a guitar which he plays better than Hendrix.

Sure enough, the second he looks down, there's his fucking doberman again, gnawing his leg.\\n\\n\\\"GAH!

He plops down on his knees behind Pig, and gets back to business.\\n\\nAmongst his passion, the man recognizes a sudden pain in his lower leg. He detaches from his piggy fantasies to see the doberman teeth-deep into his ankle yet again, blood all over.\\n\\n\\\"OH GOD DAMMIT PISS!\\\" He dresses his wounds, and then in overwhelming frustration, the man collapses for a nap.\\n\\nThe next day the man is staring into the horizon, when he sees a ship. He looks closer only to notice that there is a figure atop the ship, a woman.

Here, rook at Voodoo Dirdo,\\\" says the old man in his thick Asian accent.\\n\\nThe old man behind the counter then opens a drawer in front of him and takes out a old wooden box covered in ancient Sanskrit writing. The buisnessman scoffs at the old geezer, thinking that this must be some sort of scam...but he's curious.\\n\\n\\\"Voodoo Dildo, huh? What's so special about it, will it make my wife scream so loudly that she raises the dead? Because I won't be impressed with anything short that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Voodoo Dirdo make you wife scweam,\\\" The old man says with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.\\n\\nThen, he opens the box while the business man looks on intently. He opens it very slowly, adding to the suspense. But what's inside just looks like an ancient piece of wood sanded and smoothed into phallic shape.\\n\\n\\\"Sir, I don't think-\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Voodoo Dirdo, exeet!\\\" The man behind the counter says just as the business man is about to protest.\\n\\nSuddenly, the wooden dildo starts levitating out of the box. Slowly at first, but then in an instant, it shoots past the businessman and starts beating rhythmically on the exit door. Just as the Voodoo Dildo is about to break through the glass, the old man summons it back to the box.\\n\\nThe businessman stands there in utter shock for a moment, but then quickly takes out his wallet and hands his credit card to the old man.\\n\\n\\\"That'll be a thousand, right?\\\"\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe next night, the man's wife is at home and is starting to yearn for her husband. She's getting really turned on when she remembers the gift he had given her before he left for the airport.\\n\\nThe woman goes into the master bedroom and takes the old wooden box out of the drawer in the nightstand by her and her husbands' bed. She opens the box and takes out the instructions her husband had written for.\\n\\n\\\"Okay, well...I guess it's worth a try,\\\" she says to herself as gets comfortable in the bed.\\n\\n**STEP 1. SAY \\\"VOODOO DILDO\\\"**\\n\\n**STEP 2. SAY THE BODY PART YOU WANT PENETRATED**\\n\\nThe woman thinks this sounds simple enough, so she takes the Dildo out of the box.\\n\\n\\\"Voodoo Dildo, my pussy.\\\"\\n\\nThe wooden dildo immediately starts pounding the woman's vagina, and within minutes she has already had several orgasms. The woman is lost in bliss, and before she knows it, two hours have flown by and she is satisfied and exhausted. The woman puts a hand between her legs to try and grab the Voodoo Dildo, but it won't stop it's rhythmic thrusts.\\n\\n\\\"Fuck.\\\"\\n\\nThe woman realizes that her husband never told her how to make the Voodoo Dildo stop. She starts to panic, and decides to call 911 to try and get an ambulance to take her to the hospital, seeing as she is in no state to drive herself.\\n\\n\\\"Hell-oh! Yeees! Oh, please he-elp! There's a Voodoo Dild-oh! inside of me, and I don't know how (moan) to make it stop.\\\"\\n\\nThe line is silent for a moment, then the woman hears someone say, \\\"Damn prank callers.\\\"\\n\\n*Click.*\\n\\nThe woman realizes doesn't have any choice but to try and drive herself to the hospital. So, she puts on a skirt and other clothes, and stumbles to her car, all the while still being pounded by the dildo.\\n\\nOn the way to the hospital, she is swerving pretty badly. She is tired, and can barely hold on to the steering wheel, let alone actually steer because of the Dildo. When the woman is less than a mile from the emergency room, she sees blue and red lights flashing behind her after making a pretty noticeable swerve. \\n\\nShe pulls over and rolls her window down.\\n\\n\\\"Ma'am, have you been drinking tonight?\\\" The policeman asks the woman who, to be fair, looks like she's had a few drinks too many because of her messy hair and makeup.\\n\\n\\\"No oh-officer,\\\" The woman replies, still moaning involuntarily, realizing that he must not be able to see her ordeal because of how dark it is, \\\"It's j-uh-ust that my husband (mmm) gave me this Voodoo Dildo and-and I ca-ahh-n't figure out how to get it to st-ooooh-op.\\\"\\n\\nThe officer smirks at her and then pulls out his radio to call in a DUI.

She took a drive downtown to her local sex shop to find a new toy to her liking. After about an half hour of browsing the typical fare she went up to the shop keep, and asked for her advice. Mary expressed her lack of interest in most of the toys and asked the store keep if she could recommend the best dildo on the market. The shop keep, looking a bit skittish said \\\"mam, this isn't sold on the market, but this here box will solve all your worrys!\\\". Brandishing a small wooden box, the shop keep quickly places the box next to Mary and proclaimed \\\"this right here.....is a magic dildo!\\\". Mary is sceptical at first, but the shop keep, seeming sure of herself, explained how it works. \\\"You see mam, all you have to do is open this box and say, magic dildo my pussy. and it will immediately get to work; It takes all sorts of voice commands, and never runs out of batteries!\\\". Mary, thoroughly sold at this point, bought the magic dildo and rushed home to use it. She arrived home in record speed, and prepared a relaxing bubble bath as setting for her new toy. She sat the box down next to the tub, disrobes, and hoped into her bubble bath. leaning over, mary opened the box and whispers \\\"magic dildo my pussy\\\". As if by mystical forces,  a dildo arised from the box, headed for her nether regions, and slide easily in,  moving in rhythm like a human partner. Mary was is in ecstasy! for two hours she enjoyed her bubble bath, climaxing several times, till finally she is exhausted. \\\"Magic dildo stop\\\" sayed Mary, starting to get sore from all the attention. The voice command tho didn't seem to work, and discomfort increasing, Mary tried a slew of other impromptu voice commands to no avail. Another hour of bliss turned to agony occurs, and now Mary is freaking the fuck out, this thing won't fucking stop! She shakenly gets dressed and gets into her car, hell bent on getting to a hospital or something to get this devilish thing out of her. As she is driving she experiences an intense orgasam and swerved out of lane smack into a lamp post, and thru to the brick wall behind it. Waking to the constant throbbing of her head and privates, she discovers a police officer knocking on her window. \\\"Miss, are you ok, man, can I help you?\\\" The cop asked, worried by the pale and trembling demeanor of this woman.

The husband asked his wife \\\"how was the encounter for you?\\\" \\\"Oh, mine was great!\\\" She answered \\\"how was yours?\\\" \\\"Ugh, mine was terrible!\\\" He groaned \\\"she kept yanking my ear and hitting me on the forehead!\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Martian swingers\",\n        \"upvotes\": 23\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5uklpf\",\n        \"num_comments\": 2,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"the hole you stick the cucumber in\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Whats the difference between hungry and horny\",\n        \"upvotes\": 20\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5tetfm\",\n        \"num_comments\": 3,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"A woman is walking on the beach, when she sees a man with no arms and no legs laying on a beach towel.  \\n\\nThe man says, \\\"Excuse me, miss?

It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble s**ting.\\n\\nNo, I was not constipated; this was not a regular problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that they were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my cheeks. It led to so much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butt hair dwelling. \\n\\nEventually I would have to do two things, either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover faecal matter before the toilet paper reached it's *\\\"Can't Be Flushed\\\"* threshold.\\n\\nI was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. \\n\\nHEY! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my logs will flow out like beer from a keg! It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. \\n\\n\\\"How many Indians could there be?\\\" said General Custer. \\n\\n\\\"Looks like a good day for a drive!\\\" said JFK. \\n\\n\\\"There, America Online now has complete Usenet access!\\\" said by some idiot system technician. \\n\\nSuch was my anal shaving idea.\\n\\nI performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the ravine in between began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair.\\n\\n My ass was smooth as ivory. \\n\\nI smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.\\n\\nLittle did I know.....\\n\\nI now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. \\n\\nFor one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two ass cheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic brownie molecules lingering around my chocolate starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky sweat combination. \\n\\nAs I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. GOD-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of fire ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.\\n\\nThis exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. \\n\\nEvery dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odour mixed with the tangy smell of my own s**t blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: \\n\\nWill be like this until the hair grows back? \\n\\nLater on, trying to deal with it as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. \\n\\nI attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my ass cheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.\\n\\nAs if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. \\n\\nImagine your ass having the texture of a Brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Friends, DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS HAIR!**\\n\\n\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Don't shave your ass!\",\n        \"upvotes\": 20\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5pmkpc\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Until some rotten cunt split on me. \",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"I used to be a necrophiliac...\",\n        \"upvotes\": 20\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5fuy4n\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Q: What did one saggy boob say to the other saggy boob? \\nA: \\\"We better get some support before someone thinks we're nuts!\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"saggy boob\",\n        \"upvotes\": 20\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5emcx7\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"There guy goes to a weight loss clinic and says he needs to lose 20 lbs. \\nThe receptionist sends him upstairs, where he finds a beautiful naked woman with a sign that says \\\"If you catch me, you can sex with me.\\\" \\nAn hour later, he emerges, sated and 20 lbs. lighter.\\nA month later, he returns and needs to lose 50 lbs. \\nThe receptionist sends him upstairs again, but this time there are two girls with the same sign. \\nA day later, he comes out 50 lbs. lighter.\\nA year later, he returns and needs to lose 100 lbs. \\nHe gets sent upstairs again, where he finds a huge gorilla with a sign that reads \\\"If I catch you, I FUCK you.\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Weight Loss\",\n        \"upvotes\": 19\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5dte5k\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"A bride tells her husband, \\\"Honey, you know I'm a virgin and I don't know anything about sex.

Anyway there was this bloke who wanted to know who he fucked at the end of the night so he started to think of a way to mark the girl he fucked so he can see her leave the hall at the end of the night. He walked into the hall and found a woman straight away by feeling her cunt. He then feels she was wearing a dress, he ripped the dress so he could find the woman in the carpark at end of the night. He finished fucking her, had his fun, then left.

He met with Bear and his owner, Fred, who demonstrated that Bear could come, heel, sit, lay, roll over, stay, and every other command a well-trained dog should know, and he took Bear home that night.\\n\\nThe next day, he threw a small stick for Bear to fetch and the dog just sat there staring at him.

Bear laid down and covered his face with his paw.\\n\\nTom called Fred and asked him how the ad could have said Bear was an excellent fetcher when he can't even get him to *look* at a thrown stick or rope.

I guess I could get into that, if it'll keep Bear happy.\\\"\\n\\nA week later, Tom calls Fred and asks \\\"Your ad also said he was an excellent catcher, was that a typo, too?\\\" Fred confirms that the ad was correct and Tom replies, asking \\\"Then why did he bite my cock off after I pulled out of him?\\\"\\n\\nAfter a few moments of silence, Fred answers. \\\"Bear loves to catch frisbees and tennis balls.\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"A Dog Named Bear\",\n        \"upvotes\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"1viwba\",\n        \"num_comments\": 2,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"lets blow eachother.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"What did the hair dryer say to the fan\",\n        \"upvotes\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5d4eho\",\n        \"num_comments\": 2,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nC4L6BmBf4\\nDon't do drugs and drive while getting head. \",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Driving while getting road head gone wrong\",\n        \"upvotes\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"4xe8y6\",\n        \"num_comments\": 1,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Hey guys!

It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble s**ting.\\n\\nNo, I was not constipated; this was not a regular problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that they were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my cheeks. It led to so much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butt hair dwelling. \\n\\nEventually I would have to do two things, either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover faecal matter before the toilet paper reached it's *\\\"Can't Be Flushed\\\"* threshold.\\n\\nI was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. \\n\\nHEY! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my logs will flow out like beer from a keg! It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. \\n\\n\\\"How many Indians could there be?\\\" said General Custer. \\n\\n\\\"Looks like a good day for a drive!\\\" said JFK. \\n\\n\\\"There, America Online now has complete Usenet access!\\\" said by some idiot system technician. \\n\\nSuch was my anal shaving idea.\\n\\nI performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the ravine in between began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair.\\n\\n My ass was smooth as ivory. \\n\\nI smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.\\n\\nLittle did I know.....\\n\\nI now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. \\n\\nFor one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two ass cheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic brownie molecules lingering around my chocolate starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky sweat combination. \\n\\nAs I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. GOD-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of fire ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.\\n\\nThis exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. \\n\\nEvery dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odour mixed with the tangy smell of my own s**t blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: \\n\\nWill be like this until the hair grows back? \\n\\nLater on, trying to deal with it as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. \\n\\nI attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my ass cheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.\\n\\nAs if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. \\n\\nImagine your ass having the texture of a Brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Friends, DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS HAIR!**\\n\\n\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Don't shave your ass!\",\n        \"upvotes\": 22\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5vt5gz\",\n        \"num_comments\": 6,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Pussy. \",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"9/10 redditors won't get this.\",\n        \"upvotes\": 25\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5umc77\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"The taste\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"What is the difference between an oral thermometer and an anal thermometer?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 29\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5uklpf\",\n        \"num_comments\": 2,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"the hole you stick the cucumber in\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Whats the difference between hungry and horny\",\n        \"upvotes\": 22\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5uko4y\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"kick his sister in the chin\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"How do you castrate a redneck\",\n        \"upvotes\": 16\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5ukpks\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"with a broom and dust pan\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"How do you pick up a hot Jewish girl\",\n        \"upvotes\": 16\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5uj6ib\",\n        \"num_comments\": 1,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"My patience and attention, as short as my cock\\nNo woman wants me, so here I beat off\\nLike I beat woman,who piss me off\\nWith my thin patience, as thin as my cock\\n\\nBut I cannot get off, from stroking my cock\\nThe lotions dried up, and turned into caulk\\nThe porno has ended, my cock has balked\\nMy sperm returns to where it came from\\n\\nMy dog has stopped eating and licking me off\\nTo eat the butter applied to my cock\\nThat is it, enough is enough\\nI fuck my dog's asshole, ragged and rough\\n\\nA chunk of shit, left on my cock\\nPulled from the hole from which it came from\\nFlies through the air on the cum for my cock\\nI just got off, I just got off\\n\\n\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Poetry, with Schitferbrains\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": false,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"5u31hh\",\n        \"num_comments\": 1,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"He gives her a quick glance then causally looks at his watch for a moment.

She took a drive downtown to her local sex shop to find a new toy to her liking. After about an half hour of browsing the typical fare she went up to the shop keep, and asked for her advice. Mary expressed her lack of interest in most of the toys and asked the store keep if she could recommend the best dildo on the market. The shop keep, looking a bit skittish said \\\"mam, this isn't sold on the market, but this here box will solve all your worrys!\\\". Brandishing a small wooden box, the shop keep quickly places the box next to Mary and proclaimed \\\"this right here.....is a magic dildo!\\\". Mary is sceptical at first, but the shop keep, seeming sure of herself, explained how it works. \\\"You see mam, all you have to do is open this box and say, magic dildo my pussy. and it will immediately get to work; It takes all sorts of voice commands, and never runs out of batteries!\\\". Mary, thoroughly sold at this point, bought the magic dildo and rushed home to use it. She arrived home in record speed, and prepared a relaxing bubble bath as setting for her new toy. She sat the box down next to the tub, disrobes, and hoped into her bubble bath. leaning over, mary opened the box and whispers \\\"magic dildo my pussy\\\". As if by mystical forces,  a dildo arised from the box, headed for her nether regions, and slide easily in,  moving in rhythm like a human partner. Mary was is in ecstasy! for two hours she enjoyed her bubble bath, climaxing several times, till finally she is exhausted. \\\"Magic dildo stop\\\" sayed Mary, starting to get sore from all the attention. The voice command tho didn't seem to work, and discomfort increasing, Mary tried a slew of other impromptu voice commands to no avail. Another hour of bliss turned to agony occurs, and now Mary is freaking the fuck out, this thing won't fucking stop! She shakenly gets dressed and gets into her car, hell bent on getting to a hospital or something to get this devilish thing out of her. As she is driving she experiences an intense orgasam and swerved out of lane smack into a lamp post, and thru to the brick wall behind it. Waking to the constant throbbing of her head and privates, she discovers a police officer knocking on her window. \\\"Miss, are you ok, man, can I help you?\\\" The cop asked, worried by the pale and trembling demeanor of this woman. Mary weakly tries to describe what's going on, but only manages to mutter \\\"help me... There is a magic dildo trapped inside me\\\". The officer, in confusion, and rising impatience for these crazy mutterings of a most likely drunk driver looks Mary in the eyes and says \\\"magic dildo???... Magic dildo my ass!\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Magic dildo\",\n        \"upvotes\": 44\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"4oac8x\",\n        \"num_comments\": 1,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Did you hear the breaking news today...

He finished fucking her, had his fun, then left. He then went left when the fuck fest finished light up a cigarette and waited for the girl to leave but he couldn't see her at all so he decided to leave and go home.

He asks how he can join them so as to continue drinking at this particular bar.\\nHe's told that there are three tasks that he needs to complete to become a member:\\n\\n1. Drink 6 full pitchers down one by one without taking any breaks, vomiting, or spilling any.\\n\\n2. Remove an abscess tooth from a hungry and angry pitbull.\\n\\n3. Fuck a 65 year old hooker to the point that she orgasms.\\n\\nUndeterred, he agrees to complete the tasks. They lead him outside to 6 pitchers of dark beer waiting for him on a long table. He quickly drinks down all six of them without spilling a drop. He wipes off his chin and says \\\"Alright boys, that one down.\\\"\\n\\nImpressed, the Hell's Angels take him around back to a shed where he hears a dog growling and snarling inside. They tell him to go in and complete his second task. The man hesitates for a second but visibly quite drunk by this point, shrugs and says \\\"what the hell\\\", and goes in (The Hell's Angels all stay outside in case things get ugly). A minute or two, the barking and growling intensifies as the dog is clearly upset, but then suddenly the dog makes a little yelp, then whimpers a bit, and then all goes quiet. Another few seconds later the prospective Hell's Angel stumbles out from the shed looking somewhat beat up, and bloody, but quite satisfied with himself. He then looks around at the Hell's Angels who are all visibly impressed and says. \\\"That's two tasks done. I'm almost there, boys.

So, he decides to go to sex shop and get her a dildo to hold her over until he gets back.\\n\\nSo, he goes into the sex shop the night before he's set to leave and looks around for a while. He looks at every single toy in the store, from vibrators to dildos, and even anal beads. With every single toy he looks at, he thinks, \\\"There is no way this will satisfy my wife. This is not good enough.\\\"\\n\\nEventually, the man gives up, and starts walking toward the exit. As he gets near the front of the store, a little Asian man suddenly appears behind the counter near the door.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, so you tink dat none de toys in here satisfy you wife?\\\" The man behind the counter asks the man as he walks by.\\n\\nThe businessman stops in his tracks, and turns to face to the little Asian grandpa that spoke to him.\\n\\n\\\"Sir, if you really have anything that could satisfy my wife, I will pay one thousand dollars for it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ooh, I do. Here, rook at Voodoo Dirdo,\\\" says the old man in his thick Asian accent.\\n\\nThe old man behind the counter then opens a drawer in front of him and takes out a old wooden box covered in ancient Sanskrit writing. The buisnessman scoffs at the old geezer, thinking that this must be some sort of scam...but he's curious.\\n\\n\\\"Voodoo Dildo, huh? What's so special about it, will it make my wife scream so loudly that she raises the dead? Because I won't be impressed with anything short that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Voodoo Dirdo make you wife scweam,\\\" The old man says with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.\\n\\nThen, he opens the box while the business man looks on intently. He opens it very slowly, adding to the suspense. But what's inside just looks like an ancient piece of wood sanded and smoothed into phallic shape.\\n\\n\\\"Sir, I don't think-\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Voodoo Dirdo, exeet!\\\" The man behind the counter says just as the business man is about to protest.\\n\\nSuddenly, the wooden dildo starts levitating out of the box. Slowly at first, but then in an instant, it shoots past the businessman and starts beating rhythmically on the exit door. Just as the Voodoo Dildo is about to break through the glass, the old man summons it back to the box.\\n\\nThe businessman stands there in utter shock for a moment, but then quickly takes out his wallet and hands his credit card to the old man.\\n\\n\\\"That'll be a thousand, right?\\\"\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe next night, the man's wife is at home and is starting to yearn for her husband. She's getting really turned on when she remembers the gift he had given her before he left for the airport.\\n\\nThe woman goes into the master bedroom and takes the old wooden box out of the drawer in the nightstand by her and her husbands' bed. She opens the box and takes out the instructions her husband had written for.\\n\\n\\\"Okay, well...I guess it's worth a try,\\\" she says to herself as gets comfortable in the bed.\\n\\n**STEP 1. SAY \\\"VOODOO DILDO\\\"**\\n\\n**STEP 2. SAY THE BODY PART YOU WANT PENETRATED**\\n\\nThe woman thinks this sounds simple enough, so she takes the Dildo out of the box.\\n\\n\\\"Voodoo Dildo, my pussy.\\\"\\n\\nThe wooden dildo immediately starts pounding the woman's vagina, and within minutes she has already had several orgasms. The woman is lost in bliss, and before she knows it, two hours have flown by and she is satisfied and exhausted. The woman puts a hand between her legs to try and grab the Voodoo Dildo, but it won't stop it's rhythmic thrusts.\\n\\n\\\"Fuck.\\\"\\n\\nThe woman realizes that her husband never told her how to make the Voodoo Dildo stop. She starts to panic, and decides to call 911 to try and get an ambulance to take her to the hospital, seeing as she is in no state to drive herself.\\n\\n\\\"Hell-oh! Yeees! Oh, please he-elp! There's a Voodoo Dild-oh! inside of me, and I don't know how (moan) to make it stop.\\\"\\n\\nThe line is silent for a moment, then the woman hears someone say, \\\"Damn prank callers.\\\"\\n\\n*Click.*\\n\\nThe woman realizes doesn't have any choice but to try and drive herself to the hospital. So, she puts on a skirt and other clothes, and stumbles to her car, all the while still being pounded by the dildo.\\n\\nOn the way to the hospital, she is swerving pretty badly.

When he came across an ad that read \\\"Free to good home: Beautiful black lab named Bear, excellent fetcher and catcher\\\" he knew he'd found his dog. He met with Bear and his owner, Fred, who demonstrated that Bear could come, heel, sit, lay, roll over, stay, and every other command a well-trained dog should know, and he took Bear home that night.\\n\\nThe next day, he threw a small stick for Bear to fetch and the dog just sat there staring at him. Thinking the stick wasn't big enough to interest Bear, he tried throwing a bigger one. Bear just whined. When sticks didn't interest him, Tom tried throwing a short, knotted piece of rope. Bear laid down and covered his face with his paw.\\n\\nTom called Fred and asked him how the ad could have said Bear was an excellent fetcher when he can't even get him to *look* at a thrown stick or rope.

I guess I could get into that, if it'll keep Bear happy.\\\"\\n\\nA week later, Tom calls Fred and asks \\\"Your ad also said he was an excellent catcher, was that a typo, too?\\\" Fred confirms that the ad was correct and Tom replies, asking \\\"Then why did he bite my cock off after I pulled out of him?\\\"\\n\\nAfter a few moments of silence, Fred answers. \\\"Bear loves to catch frisbees and tennis balls.\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"A Dog Named Bear\",\n        \"upvotes\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"31vrf8\",\n        \"num_comments\": 2,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"A cab driver pulled up at a stop sign near Central Park in New York.\\n\\nA stark naked woman jumped out from behind a bush, opened the back door of the cab and demanded to be taken to the airport.\\n\\n\\nThe cab driver kept looking back at his passenger in the rear view mirror, and she became irritated and said, \\\"Why do you keep staring at me?\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe cab driver replied, \\\"Well, you don't have any clothes on and no place to carry any money and I am wondering how you are going to pay your fare?\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe woman opened her legs and pointed to her crotch and said, \\\"How about me paying with this?\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe cab driver looked back at the woman and said, \\\"Do you have anything smaller?\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": true,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"the Cab ride\",\n        \"upvotes\": 60\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"31biwp\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"It's gonna take me a little while to get hard, I just got laid by this chick.\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"What did the egg say to the boiling water?\",\n        \"upvotes\": 55\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"30u1sk\",\n        \"num_comments\": 2,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"3 unborn triplet girls  were sitting inside their mom's stomach talking about what they wanted to do when they grow up.

His ship capsizes, and the man wakes up on the shore of a desert island with only one pig, and his trusty doberman, who was sailing with them. The man adapts, survives, etc. Fishes with a spear, makes fire, builds his own hut, purifies his own water, and feeds his four-legged friends, etc. Cast Away style and shit.\\n\\nAfter a few months the man starts to get a little *lonely*. The pig is starting to look pretty good -- that soft, pink flesh, that nice, round ass... those thin, wiry, blonde hair strands.\\n\\nSo one day he's gazing into the eyes of his beautiful pig. He pets his pig. He then begins to grope his pig. One thing leads to another, and soon enough, the man is inside of his pig, performing smooth, insidious thrusts. In the heat of his moment, the man's doberman starts biting at his ankle, trying to wrangle him around.\\n\\n\\\"AH SHIT!\\\" the man yells, and kicks the dog, nursing his injury.\\n\\nDays later, Dog's out on the beach digging a hole or whatever... chasing crabs and shit. The man is yet again alone with his pig and starts to feel that urge.\\n\\nHe goes over to the pig, double-checks to see his dog preoccupied, and starts railing this pig. Sure enough, the second he looks down, there's his fucking doberman again, gnawing his leg.\\n\\n\\\"GAH! DAMMIT WHAT THE FUCK???\\\" He screams, kicks some sand at the dog, and wraps up his ankle with some leaves.\\n\\nNext day, man sees his dog playing with a stick.\\n\\nThinks, \\\"Hm... dog+stick...\\\"\\n\\nTakes the stick, and throws it as far as he can into the jungle. Dog bolts into the trees in pursuit of the stick.\\n\\n\\\"AIN'T NO DOG GONNA FIND NO STICK IN NO JUNGLE! HA! HA! HA!\\\" he exclaims, running for his pig. He plops down on his knees behind Pig, and gets back to business.\\n\\nAmongst his passion, the man recognizes a sudden pain in his lower leg. He detaches from his piggy fantasies to see the doberman teeth-deep into his ankle yet again, blood all over.\\n\\n\\\"OH GOD DAMMIT PISS!\\\" He dresses his wounds, and then in overwhelming frustration, the man collapses for a nap.\\n\\nThe next day the man is staring into the horizon, when he sees a ship. He looks closer only to notice that there is a figure atop the ship, a woman. Not only is she a woman, but a drop-dead gorgeous woman.\\n\\nSo Dude swims out there Baywatch style, saves the woman just as the ship sinks below the surface, and brings her back to his island. She's completely unconscious.\\n\\nHe finally revives her and she says to him, \\\"Oh my god thank you so much! You saved my life!! I wish there was something I could do to repay you! Oh! Anything, I'll do anything!\\\"\\n\\nSo, Dude thinks for a minute and says: \\\"Well... you wanna take my dog for a walk?\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"The Pig-Fucker Joke\",\n        \"upvotes\": 57\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2f4qgh\",\n        \"num_comments\": 2,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"the perfect Christmas gift is a dildo and a pair of sandal's, so if the receiver does not like the sandals, they can go f**k themself\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"perfect Christmas gift\",\n        \"upvotes\": 11\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2f654n\",\n        \"num_comments\": 1,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"http://mangafox.me/manga/koe_de_oshigoto/v01/c009/17.html\\n\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"why fellatio exist in 1 comic page (Koe de Oshigoto)\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2f2lnz\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"Have you ever noticed that it's only 'perfect' people who are murdered or killed in horrific accidents?\\n\\\"He was the perfect son\\\" or \\\"She was the perfect daughter.\\\"\\n\\\"Such a tragic accident they were the perfect family.\\\"\\n\\\"They died together, the perfect couple till the end.\\\"\\nMakes me glad I abuse my kids and beat up my wife.\\nKind of makes me immortal\\n\\n\\n\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Immortality\",\n        \"upvotes\": 13\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2f2hl2\",\n        \"num_comments\": 1,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"BBC Headline : 'Thalidomide survivors to get \\u00a320m'\\n\\nI was shocked, I expected a small hand out.\\n\\n\\n\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"The BBC\",\n        \"upvotes\": 19\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2f2l1r\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"My daughter has Bieber fever.\\n\\nOr, as it's medically known, Down's Syndrome.\\n\\n\\n\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Bieber\",\n        \"upvotes\": 14\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2f2kbd\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"I saw CountDown yesterday.\\n\\nHe's Dracula's spastic brother.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Countdown\",\n        \"upvotes\": 13\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2f2h1b\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"The EU has lifted a ban on misshapen vegetables.\\n\\nThank fuck - I can finally let my mongoloid son out of the cellar.\\n\\n\\n\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"The European Union\",\n        \"upvotes\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2f4g09\",\n        \"num_comments\": 0,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"I'm a brown belt in anal play and i started off a white belt as most people, although some people start off as a black belt and end up with a couple red stripes afterwards\",\n        \"over_18\": true,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Brown belt\",\n        \"upvotes\": 0\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"2exxor\",\n        \"num_comments\": 3,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \" Three women are in the Ob/Gyn office knitting.

She let out a little gasp, turned her head to face me, and said, \\\"Don't you think that was a little presumptuous?\\\" to which I replied, \\\"isn't presumptuous kind of a big word for a seven year old?\\\"\",\n        \"over_18\": false,\n        \"stickied\": false,\n        \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qzld\",\n        \"title\": \"Presumptuous.\",\n        \"upvotes\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"archived\": true,\n        \"domain\": \"self.DirtyJokes\",\n        \"downvotes\": 0,\n        \"id\": \"itl7u\",\n        \"num_comments\": 1,\n        \"num_reports\": null,\n        \"original_post\": \"...and in his sloshed state, he raises a glass and says, \\\"To many years between my wife's legs!\\\"\\n\\nHis drunk friends find his toast to be completely hilarious, and pay for his drinks for the rest of the night.

The next day, walking down the street, she passes one of her husband's hungover friends. He asks her if she had heard about the toast.\\n\\n She replies, \\\"Yes, I heard, but I don't really understand.
