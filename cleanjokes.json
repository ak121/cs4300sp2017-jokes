Confused, the townsfolk got out of bed and traced the sound to the nearby Tyne river, where they spotted something incredible - an enormous frog, possibly the largest ever, sitting on a huge lily pad. At first, the townsfolk wanted to get rid of the frog, as its loud croaking would soon drive everyone crazy. But since it was just so uncommonly large, they all agreed to keep it as a tourist attraction instead.\n\nHowever, after a day of endless croaking and a sleepless night for all of Clara Vale, the town knew that they just had to get rid of it. Unfortunately though, every time someone attempted to capture the frog, it would hop into the water, only to return to its lily pad and resume its loud croaking not long after.\n\nAfter many days of incessant croaking, a person decided to dive into the river and capture the frog that way; unfortunately the frog was just way too fast. However, just before the diver gave up, he noticed something sitting at the bottom of the river - a collar with an address tag on it!\n\nThe diver handed in the collar to the local police, and, after they inspected it, they knew that it must have been attached the frog. The police drove to the address on the collar's tag and knocked on the house door. A very ashamed-looking old man hobbled out.\n\n\"Sir.\" said one of the policeman. \"We have been notified that the enormous frog that has become such a nuisance belongs to you. We found its collar in the river.\"\n\nThe guilty old man, starting to cry, confessed.\n\n\"He escaped!\" the old man wailed. \"The frog on the Tyne is all mine, all mine!

Please don't hesitate to throw these post op instructions in the nearest waste receptacle. \n\nPOST-OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS FOR LAPAROSCOPY\r\n\nLaparoscopic surgery may be performed for the diagnosis of pelvic pain, for evaluation of uterine or ovarian masses, for management of ectopic (tubal) pregnancy, to locate lost keys, for tubal sterilization, or for removal of an ovary or ovarian\rcyst.\r\n\nYou may feel some chest, shoulder or abdominal discomfort for a few days. This discomfort is a result of the \r\nHydrogen gas that was introduced in the abdomen during surgery. Your body will absorb this gas after 24 to 48 hours and over the next few days you will produce a series of violent and unexpected farts. For relief, you may apply heat to your abdomen or lay flat. Under no circumstances should you go near to a flame source! (Much blood, many deaths)\n\nIt is important to take a stool softener such as Dynamite while taking narcotic pain medication such as Percocet \r\nor Vicodin. Please purchase a stool softener before your surgery. In addition it would be wise to line the walls of \r\nyour bathroom with non-stick material in case of an accidental overdose of the stool softener.\r\n\nYou may take \u201cover the counter\u201d pain relievers that do not contain aspirin such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or \r\nibuprofen (Motrin or Advil). Do not exceed the daily recommended dose.\r\nNote: If the pain is not relieved by pain medication, becomes worse, or you have difficulty breathing, call our office.\r\n\nLaparoscopic incisions are closed with skin adhesive which may have a bluish/shiny appearance on the skin and/or with subcutaneous (under the skin) suture.\r\nInspect your incisions daily. Try not to faint or vomit.\r\n\nA large amount of blood or clear drainage from the incisions is normal and not a cause for concern.\r\n\nBruising around your incision sites is common and a cause for concern.\r\nYour incisions may be itchy for a few days. This is part of the normal healing process.\r\n\nAs your incisions heal, they will change in color and may become numb for several weeks.\n\nIf you have small dressings or Band-Aids, they may be removed in 24 hours.\r\n\nIf you have steri-strips (small adhesive strips) in place, they will peel and fall off. If they do not fall off in 10 \r\ndays, carefully peel them off.\r\n\nIf you have stitches, they will dissolve on their own.\r\n\nIf you have none of the above your surgeon had one too many sherbets at the club and has forgotten to close the \r\nwounds. \r\n\nNote: If you notice any redness, heavy drainage, your bum falls off, or bleeding from your incisions, call our office.\r\n\nYou may resume the diet you had prior to surgery if you are brave.\r\n\nDrink 600-800 glasses of fizzy pop daily and then bounce vigorously on a trampoline. (We have always \r\nwondered what would happen.)\r\n\nFor the first several days after surgery, the bowel is usually less active. You may not have a regular bowel movement right away depending on pre-op bowel prep or pain medication use. \n\nIf, after six months you have not had a decent crap, you may have a problem. This usually proves to be as a result of your surgeon forgetting the purpose of the procedure and deciding that all that stuff in there looked disgusting and removed it. Sadly you will have to snake a garden hose up your clacka as a makeshift replacement for your bowel.\r\n\nNarcotic pain medication (Percocet, Vicodin, Selleys Stop Leak, building putty, hydrocodone or oxycodone) \r\nwill increase constipation.\r\n\nBowel movements will be deceptively violent and it would be best to wear a wetsuit with the butt removed at all \r\ntimes until regular motions return.\r\n\nIf constipation should occur:\r\n\n\uf0b7 Drink more fluids\r\n\n\uf0b7 Continue to take a stool softener such as dynamite until constipation resolves\r\n\n\uf0b7 Take a mild laxative such as Bob\u2019s Mega Poo.\r\n\nMild abdominal swelling can occur following surgery due to removal of the bowels and hydrogen gas used to \r\ndistend the abdomen during surgery and as a source of childish amusement for the operating room staff.\r\n\nSwelling of the head and lower extremities is common due to fluids given during surgery.\r\n\nSwelling of the face can occur due to positioning during surgery.\n\nIf you have swelling of the calves that is persistent or associated with redness, call our office.\r\n\nIt is normal to feel tired for a few days after surgery. Listen to the voices in your head and do not overdo it.\r\n\nWeight lifting is encouraged immediately after surgery, as tolerated. You should NOT be bedridden after surgery as continued movement will prevent prolonged recovery times due to \u201cblobbage.\u201d\r\n\nIf you could climb stairs un-aided prior to surgery you are a show off.\r\n\nIf your incisions are 5 millimeters (the width of a pencil), you may resume your normal activities and exercise \r\nregimen after two weeks.\r\n\nIf your incisions are 10 millimeters (finger width) or larger, you should avoid strenuous activities such as heavy \r\nlifting (greater than 10 pounds or a gallon of milk), pushing or pulling for six weeks.\r\n\nDo not drive while taking prescription pain medication or if your level of discomfort could inhibit your ability to \r\noperate a motor vehicle safely.\r\n\nMost patients are able to return to work after two minutes. Recovery times vary from patient to patient. Your \r\ndoctor will make recommendations based on your level of woosiness.\r\n\nYou may shower the day after surgery. Pat incisions dry. Do not rub incisions with washcloth or towel but use \r\nsteel wool. Keep your incisions as moist as possible.\r\n\nYou will need a bath after six weeks as everyone will tell you. You must also wait six weeks to go into a swimming pool, hot tub, or the ocean. Indeed with the abdominal swelling you may be mistaken for a hump back and harpooned.\r\n\nSurgery can alter your menstrual cycles. Your first cycle should have training wheels and a little bell, and could occur early or late. Your guess is as good as ours. If your cycle is more than seven days late, you should take a home pregnancy test if you have been \u2018doing the naughty.\u2019\r\n\nYou should schedule a follow-up post-operative appointment at two weeks and at six weeks.\r\n\n\uf0b7 A fever higher than 600.4 degrees C\r\n\n\uf0b7 Increasing pain not controlled by pain medication\r\n\n\uf0b7 Inability to eat or drink without vomiting\r\n\n\uf0b7 Shortness of breath\r\n\n\uf0b7 Inability to empty your bladder with urine squirting from your ears.\r\n\n\uf0b7 Redness and tenderness at the incision site, or a large amount of drainage\r\n\n\uf0b7 Heavy, bright red critter tearing its way out of your belly. \n\nYou can expect to have small reddish-brown colored feet for up to two weeks. Do not be alarmed by this.\n\nIf you feel you need to be seen urgently, please go to a different hospital where your surgery was not performed \r\nas our physicians have been fired for being drunk and insane whilst operating.\r\nAny questions regarding your surgery or post-operative recovery should be googled.

She ran all over the neighborhood, in a state of hysterics, looking for Peepers.\n\nNancy's mother eventually managed to calm her down.

They were regularly over at one anothers house, all of that jazz.\n\nOne day, when they were old and grey, they all went shopping, as they did rather regularly. The men, also as per their custom, would occasionally stop shopping and sit on a nearby park bench until the wives came out of the shop, telling dirty jokes to one another and generally being ornery. The bench they chose today was across the street from the shop, so they had a great view of the door for when the wives got done shopping.\n\nAfter a while, they see something up the hill, headed down the street towards them. Someone was recklessly rollerblading down the street, and as the man got closer it became clear he was high on drugs and had no sense of reality. Just then, the wives open the door and start walking out. Thinking fast, Mortimer throws his cane in front of the man, hoping to trip him up and stop him before he ran into the wives. Unfortunately it sent him flying and he still hit the women, killing them instantly.\n\nSteve looks at the tragedy before him. Being a smart-Alec, he then says to his friend, \"Well, Morty.

The vet, mumbling to himself, looked at the horse and said \"I don't suppose I can get you to forget the whole thing and just split the rancher's money with me 50/50?\" Much to his surprise, the horse replied and agreed to his plan. Baffled, but still wanting to get out of the smelly work, he promised the horse to return in a week with the money.  A week went by, and the vet decided to keep all the money for himself. \"After all,\" he thought \"what use does a horse have for money?\" Another week passed and the rancher called the vet, very upset. \"My horse has stopped eating again! You must not have done a thorough job. I want you to come back out and fix the problem, and I'm not paying for it this time.\"  The vet had no choice. Regretting his mistakes, he decided to take along the cash to bribe the horse with, but he brought only $20 in small bills, assuming the horse couldn't count.  When he arrived, the rancher insisted on supervising the examination. The vet approached the horse and gave a discreet nod, motioning to the wad of bills in his hand which he dropped in the corner of the stall.  Thinking the worst was over, the vet began to inspect the horse's tooth in earnest.

Now there is this level 0 cheerio. Hes homeless, living out on the street, probaly an alchoholic. But he falls in love with a frosted cheerio princess. So one day he sneaks into the royal gala and goes up to the princess and asks her \"will you marry me?\" Now she says \"I like your style, youre a good looking guy, a bit scruffy but I like you. Tell you what I will marry you if you can become a frosted cheerio\" So our guy goes back with a determination and gets a job and starts to pay off his debts. Now by having a job and his debts paid he becomes a level 1 cheerio. So he works, and he works, and he works, and he WORKS and he finally becomes a level 2 cheerio. Now he goes back to the princess and askes her again, \"will you marry me?\" she says \"no honey you really do have to become a frosted cheerio first.\" So he goes back and he works and works, hes a fryboy at McGrubers or something, I dont care. So he works and he works and he gets promoted at the restraunt and is making more money. And he works and he works and he works and by having that income raise he finally becomes a level 3 cheerio. He feels sucessful for the first time in his life but he is starting to fall back on his old ways. One day he goes to the casino and he loses and he loses and he loses and he gambled all his money away and he gets fired to boot because gambling is against company policy. So he is back down to a level 1 cheerio. He gets a job on a production line at a nearby factory and determines himself not to fall back ever again. So he works and he works and he works and he works and he WORKS, level 2, level 3, and he is doing great again. He is promoted to Floor manager of the factory and he is doing great and becomes a level 4 cheerio. But then one day a rival company sabotages their operation by putting poison in their toothpaste or whatever the hell they were making. They have to pay out damages and PR and the like and they declare bankruptcy. He is knocked back down to level 2 for the lack in income. But he is hired almost straight away by a branch of a huge conglomerate because they recognized how hard of a worker he is. So he works, level 3, works, level 4, and he works and works and WORKS. So he is promoted to CEO of the branch that he works in. A few months pass and he is approaching level 5 status when the Head of the entire conglomerate decides to retire. He weighs his options for his replacement and sees our guy and what a hard worker he is and chooses him as his replacement. So our guy is now the CEO of a huge company, a level 5 cheerio and making Bill Gates level money and he finally becomes a Frosted Cheerio. So he goes to the princess and asks her again, \"will you marry me?\" and she says \"Yes I will marry you now.\" So a few months pass and theyre at the wedding recption, they allready said their vows and the party is winding down. The newlywed wife tells her husband \"Hey I'm thirsty, can you go over to the bar and get me a Gin and Tonic or something?\" So the dutiful guy he is he went over to the bar and low and behold the bartender wasnt there. So he waits and he waits and he waits and he waits 15 minutes and the bartender still hadnt shown up so he decided he must have gone home since the party was winding down. So he went back to his wife and tells her the bartender wasnt there, can I get you something else? she replies: \"Ok, its fine. Here take this dollar and go buy me a Diet Coke at the vending machine in the lobby. So he goes to get it and theres a line for the machine. It was the princesses wedding so obviously a lot of people would show up. So he waits and he waits and he waits in line and he finally gets up to the machine only to find that the prices were hiked because they knew they could gouge them. So he goes back to his wife gets another dollar and waits and waits and WAITS in lineonly to find once he finally reached the front that they were out of Diet Coke. So he buys a regular Coke instead and takes it to his wife. She throws it away saying she needs to keep her figure yadda, yadda, yadda. So she tells him to get a cup off the table and get her some water from the cooler. So he goes over there and there is a line there too so he waits and he waits and he waits in line and the cooler runs out of water 5 people ahead of him. So exasperated he goes back to his wife and tells her, look there out of water is there any other source of liquid in this damn place. So she tells him \"screw it, just to go get some punch from the punch bowl.\" So he leaves, gets the punch, and comes back within a minute. She says \"wow, that was fast. What happened? How did you get it so fast?\" and he replies \"Well it was a short wait because there was no punchline.\"", "domain": "self.cleanjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1363969160, "id": "1at0jk"}, {"title": "Why did the chicken cross the road?", "selftext": "To get to the moron's house.\n\n*knock knock*\n\n^^Whose ^^there?\n\n*the chicken...*", "domain": "self.cleanjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1363926872, "id": "1as6de"}, {"title": "Why does Snoop Dogg use an umbrella?

The kid floored it out of the gas station. At first he didn't see anything behind him because of the dust. But as the dust cleared, he saw this tiny blue dot way back in the distance in his rear view mirror. The tiny dot began growing and growing and rapidly blurred past him. It was unbeliveably quick. He squinted and looked forward and could see way off ahead of him a tiny blue dot. It began growing and growing and again blurred past him at amazing speed until it was a tiny dot in the rearview mirror again. Once more the blue blur overtook him, but the kid realized he was approaching the county line and began to hit the brakes. Incredibly as he came to a stop at the county line, he saw the older fellow from the gas station laying in the middle of the road just ahead.

How do you put an elephant in the refrigerator?  \nA. Open the door, put the elephant in, and close the door. \n\n\nQ. How do you put a tiger in the refrigerator?  \nA. Open the door, take the elephant out, put the tiger in, and close the door. \n\n\nQ. Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?  \nA. It was dead. \n\n\nQ. Why did a second monkey fall out of the tree?  \nA. It was stapled to the first monkey. \n\n\nQ. Why did a third monkey fall out of the tree?  \nA. It was taped to the second monkey. \n\n\nQ. Why did ANOTHER monkey fall out of the tree?  \nA. Peer pressure. \n\n\nQ. What do an apple and an elephant have in common?  \nA. They're both red... except for the elephant. (I like to say the first part, then wait a beat before the second part) \n\n\nQ. What's the difference between an elephant and a plum?  \nA. Their color! \n\n\nQ. What did Tarzan say when he saw the elephants coming through the jungle?  \nA. Look! Here come the elephants! \n\n\nQ. What did Jane say when she saw the elephants coming through the jungle?  \nA. Look! Here come the plums. ... She's colorblind! \n\n\nQ. There's a big meeting in the jungle and all the animals come, except for one. Which one and why?  \nA. The tiger! You left him in the refrigerator! \n\n\nOne last note - you can mix it up if people guess an answer that's a little too close.
