The stranger gets the highest room, in the tallest tower. At 11:55, Brother Philipe hears a huge bang coming from the room, so he rushes upstairs to find a big hole in the wall and the stranger missing.\n\nA year passes and, once again, Brother Philippe is stuck with the New Year's Eve shift. Just like the previous year, the weather is horrendous - buckets of rain, howling wind, and lightning. \n\nAnd, just as it happened the previous year, at 11.30 a stranger arrives with a hood covering his face, asking for a room for the night. So Brother Philippe says \"Of course\", and gives the stranger the highest room, in the tallest tower. Once again, precisely at 11:55, Brother Philipe hears a huge bang coming from the room, so he rushes upstairs, again to find a big hole in the wall and the stranger nowhere to be found.\n\nAnother year passes and once again Brother Philippe has been assigned the New Year's Eve shift. As you might imagine, the weather is, once again, heavy, torrential rain. \n\nLike clockwork at 11:30, a stranger walks in with a hood over his head and asks for a room for the night. As was his custom, Brother Philippe says \"Of course\" and gives him the highest room in the tallest tower. \n\nBut this year Brother Philippe is prepared, and at 11:45 he walks up the stairs to the room with the stranger. He knocks on the door and the stranger answers. Brother Philippe asks, \"Are you the same person that's been coming here for the last two years?\" \n\nThe stranger slowly nods and answers that he is, indeed, the same one.\n\nSo Brother Philippe asks what the deal is about with the hole in the wall and the missing bed. The stranger looks at Brother Philippe and says, \"Can you keep a secret?\" \n\nAnd Brother Philippe answers, \"Yes\".", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1466656418, "id": "4peypd"}, {"title": "Who's the poorest Disney princess?", "selftext": "Broke-ahontas", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1466651404, "id": "4pengs"}, {"title": "Everytime a star explodes my whole mouth goes numb.", "selftext": "Must be a super novacaine!", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1466637483, "id": "4pdn4y"}, {"title": "What country has the worst vocalists in the world", "selftext": "[deleted]", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1466635986, "id": "4pdj21"}, {"title": "What actor always overcooks his seafood?", "selftext": "Lawrence Fishburne", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1466620444, "id": "4pc8wo"}, {"title": "What did the police officer say to Marco when he was speeding?", "selftext": "Marco!

Tribesmen would build canoes and compete to be the first to claim each of these islands as their own, because they were highly defensible, being surrounded by water. Each of the hundreds of islands began to develop its own unique culture, due to the difficulty of transportation between each of the islands. Because of this, as their respective technologies advanced and developed, they began to war with each other. First with spears, then with arrows, then with muskets, and finally with slugthrowers.\n\nIt was at this time that the largest and wealthiest of the islands, Ing, began work on a top-secret project. They started to develop a focused beam of microwave radiation, called a maser. The maser could be carried as a backpack, with an aiming cone attached to the arm of the user. Spies from the smaller island of Dres gathered these top-secret plans and began working on their own superweapon. They kidnapped scientists from the smaller islands of Kal and Mar, who used the idea of a focused microwave beam, but replaced the microwaves with photons, creating a so-called 'laser'. The battlefield after these two weapons were unveiled was horrific. The blasts cauterized wounds as they burned flesh away. There were no deaths, but the wounded were horrifically damaged.\n\nRepresentatives from the two islands met to declare a truce. Ing, researching the culture of Dres, noticed that they had an idiosyncratic tradition. The people of Dres looked at food as the highest form of art, and often created new recipes to commemorate important events, to declare war, or even to offer truces. The people of Ing set their best chefs on the task of creating a commemorative recipe to cement this newfound truce. Emphasizing peace not only between their two dominant cultures, but of the countless other islands who had crept into the sidelines as the wars grew bloodier and longer. Ing's dish was made to represent unity among all islands, through a fusion of the two strongest cultures. Ing's chefs designed a gourmet sauce (representing the blood of sacrifice) to be poured over uncooked vegetables (representing the innocence of peace). The sauce was called, in honor of this new truce, and of the nations that had remained neutral throughout the conflict, Thousand Island Dres-Ing.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1459229347, "id": "4ce4s4"}, {"title": "The owners tried to pressure the hotel manager into charging more for customers over 6 feet", "selftext": "but he said he wouldn't taller rate it.

We may have to remove the tooth.\"\n\n \"That's horrible doc... Am I gonna be ok?\"\n\n\"Of course you will! Like I said, it's nothing too major, so we just need to pull the tooth, get rid of the abscess, and you'll be as good as new.  I'll schedule an appointment for next week to get your tooth extracted.  If you feel any worsening pain or think you need medication, come back in and I'll check it out once more!\"\n\n\"Ok! Thanks Doctor!\"\n\nSomewhat upset about this news, George returns home and turns in for the night.  The next morning, however, his symptoms started to alter.  The pain he was experiencing before was only coming periodically.  However, it seemed that anytime a tremor of pain passed through his mouth, George would pass gas.  At first, it seemed like a mere coincidence, but as the day went on and his pains came more frequently, George began to notice that he could stop making wind.\n\nConfused about all of this, George falls asleep yet again.  Upon waking up, George immediately feels pain on his tooth and, like the day before, cuts the cheese for no reason.  However, this time was different.  When he farted, it made a strange noise.  It almost sounded like his anus was saying \"honda.\"\n\nAs the day went by, his pains started to become more frequent, and so did his farting.  However, it became more clear that every time he would fart, it sounded like someone saying \"honda.\"  Being utterly confused about all of this, George decides to ask the dentist if everything's ok with him.\n\n\"What seems to be the problem George?\"\n\n\"I don't know doc... Everytime my tooth starts to ache, for some reason, I pass gas for no reason!\"\n\n\"Hmm... that is strange... Is there anything else out of the ordinary?\"\n\n\"There is... You probably won't believe this, but whenever I do break wind, it sounds like my butt is saying \"honda\" in a winded voice. I have no idea what this means doc!\"\n\nJust as George finishes his sentence, he gets the greatest pain in his mouth that he's had since this whole ordeal started.  Immediately after, he rips out a horribly loud one right on the chair in the dentist's office.  The word \"honda\" shrieked through the whole office as this excruciating pain crossed through George's body.\n\n\"Hmm... It seems this is worse than I originally thought George. But it seems to me that it is true that *abscess makes the fart go honda.*\"\n\n\nEdit: I'm so sorry, I'm really tired...", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1441333740, "id": "3jki7i"}, {"title": "What do you call a praying mantis that doesn't pray?", "selftext": "A heretick.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1441331533, "id": "3jkdm3"}, {"title": "Why was the house paranoid?", "selftext": "It had truss-t problems !!!", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1441330424, "id": "3jkbca"}, {"title": "If life gives you accol, make accolade.", "selftext": "", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1441330250, "id": "3jkb02"}, {"title": "I fell in love with a cannibal", "selftext": "and then she stole my heart", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1441319256, "id": "3jjn7z"}, {"title": "What do you call a vegetarian with diarrhea?", "selftext": "A salad shooter.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1441310573, "id": "3jj2ed"}, {"title": "Sex with three people is a threesome, sex with four people is a foursome.", "selftext": "I guess that's why they say, I'm handsome.

He was probably the biggest fan of orange peelers in the whole wide world, and he had almost every type of orange peeler there was.

Peeling oranges was his greatest joy.\n\nFinally, after hours of searching, he found an orange peeler he didn't own. But just as he went to grab it, something shocking happened: the orange peeler spoke to him!\n\n\"Oi, if you're going to buy me, be gentle,\" it said. \"I'm very fragile.\"\n\n\"Holy shit, a talking orange peeler!\" said the man in the response.\n\n\"Yeah, I know, they all say that. I've been stuck here picking up dust for so long,\" said the orange peeler. \"But I see it in your eyes, you're an expert. Buy me, and together we will change the world of orange peelers. Together, we can make the best orange peeler there ever was!\"\n\nThe man was convinced by this talking orange peeler's argument, so he delicately grabbed it, reveling in its smooth plastic surface and high quality build.\n\n\"So how is it that you can talk, anyway?\" the man said to the orange peeler, which was now comfortably resting upon a bag of soft groceries.\n\n\"Well, it's a long story, but I was once like you,\" said the orange peeler. \"Peeling oranges was what I lived for. One day, I was on the beach, looking for some oranges to peel. Instead, I found a lamp, the kind where wish-giving genies would be.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" said the man. \"If I found one of those, every last orange peeler would be mine!\"\n\n\"I know. I was going to wish for that, myself,\" said the orange peeler. \"But at the last minute, I decided I would wish for something else.

I felt bad for all those orange peelers, getting picked and thrown in the shopping carts without any care, only to be condemned to a life of sitting in the dark, in a drawer with other kitchen appliances, never receiving the care they deserved. After a while, I started feeling like the orange peelers were talking to me. I once spoke to a vegetable peeler, even.\"\n\n\"Really?

Taking classes?\"\n\n\"Well sort of. Though actually I did stumble into a slight problem... I'm kinda strapped for cash... is there a chance I could borrow $5000 from you?\"\n\nThis set off a red flag for Lee, but after a short row and a few arguments were slung back and forth he caved.\n\n\"You'd better use that wisely\" he warned.\n\nAfter that ordeal, Stan went radio silent for another few weeks, garnering more concern for Lee. Maybe he's gotten himself into trouble again he thought and decided to give his friend another call. \n\n\"Yo Stan, I'm pretty worried about you. You've been gone for quite some time and you've not contacted anyone in that time.\"\n\n\"I know, I'm sorry. I've just been so damn busy with this stuff, you know?\"\n\n\"Uh huh, what did you do with the money I loaned you?\"\n\n\"Well, I took some metallurgy classes and I got myself a ton of pennies.\"\n\nStan was stunned. \n\n\"What the fuck dude, you were supposed to take directorial classes.\"\n\n\"Hey now, it's all according to plan.\"\n\n\"Dude seriously, how the hell is this related?\"\n\n\"You'll see don't worry&amp;mdash;I've got this under control.\"\n\nLee sighed and shook his head.\n\n\"You're crazy dude, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\n\"I swear it'll be great!\"\n\nSeveral months passed after the call with minimal contact between the two now estranged friends. Lee began to believe that he was being played like fiddle; maybe Stan went off and became a druggie and ran off with his money out of shame.\n\nStill, Lee wished well for his friend and hoped that nothing of the sort actually happened. \n\nEventually though, Stan' dedication to whatever it was that he was doing took its toll on their relationship, and the two stopped talking for many years.\n\nThat is until Stan broke the silence. \n\n\"Hey dude, I've done it! I've done as much as I could to becoming a world famous director&amp;mdash;I've got a studio and everything out in Hollywood now! Won't you come by sometime?\"\n\nLee was stunned to hear from his friend after so long and had almost rejected his request, but accepted after considering their former friendship.\n\n\"Sure, man.\"\n\n\"Great! I'll give you the grand tour of the studio!\"\n\nAnd so Lee took a plane to Hollywood. He thought about all the times he doubted his friend and how dismissive he had felt. \n\nArriving at the airport, Lee saw Stan waving a large sign over his head with \"LEE\" written in massive letters waiting for him. The two embraced each other and tried to catch up on years of lost time.\n\nStan explained the difficulties he faced in his line of work and the immense resistance he felt pushing into the field on the ride over to his studio.\n\nFinally, the two arrived at a massive building. On the building were two massive smokestacks billowing plumes of black smoke into the California air. Even outside the building, Lee was deafened by the roar of machinery and clanging metal. What kind of movie studio is this thought Lee. \n\nStan was beaming as he dragged his friend into the building. As they entered, Lee saw hundreds of workers manning an array of molds and furnaces and crucibles. He turned to Stan.\n\n\"This is a foundry, Stan. What. The. Fuck.\"\n\n\"Call it whatever you want, I still call it my studio.\"\n\nLee stood and looked at the insanity that surrounded him.\n\n\"What did you do with all of those pennies?\" he asked. Perhaps he could understand his friend's madness if he broke it down.\n\n\"Oh, I melted them down, separated the copper and zinc, and poured the metals into bouillon molds.\" He indicated a conveyor belt a ways off carrying large blocks of the aforementioned metals.\n\n\"Isn't that illegal? Won't you get in trouble?\"\n\nStan laughed.\n\n\"It would be if I weren't officially allowed to reclaim these metals for the federal government. Don't worry dude.\"\n\nLee stood bewildered at the absolute ridiculousness of the situation.\n\n\"You're literally crazy, man.\"\n\n\"I think I'll be the judge of that\" he replied. \"Come, there's one last thing I want to show you.\"\n\nDespite the silliness of it all, Lee felt a certain pride for his friend's accomplishments&amp;mdash;he must be doing very well, considering how quickly he paid back the loan and given the car we drove in thought Lee.\n\nAs they walked, Stan turned to Lee and smiled, taking his hands into his own.\n\n\"You know, I would have never come this far without your help. Everything here is thanks to you and I want to return the favor.\"\n\nThe two stopped at a massive gilded door. It loomed over the two, glimmering ominously in the dark, warm glow of the foundry. Jabbing at a keypad, Stan opened the immense doors and walked in, gesturing Lee to follow. Inside was a grand chamber decorated in ornate patterns and covered in gold leaf and velvet. In the center of the chamber stood a large stone basin beneath a massive crucible. A control panel stood next to the basin. Walking towards the panel, Stan said to his friend, \"You've helped me for so long, and I've done little to help you back.\" He fiddled with the controls and smiled at Lee. The sound of machinery rang in the chamber and everything appeared to come to life. \n\n\"What's going on? What are you doing?\"\n\nStan didn't answer. He closed his eyes and raises his arms skyward.\n\n\"I've waited years for this moment!\" his voice crackled with ecstasy. \n\n\"For what? What's happening?!\"\n\nStan smiled and turned once more to his friend, \"How far would you go to achieve your dreams? How far would you go to help someone else achieve their dreams?\"\n\n\"Dude, I don't like this. Tell me what's going on.\"\n\nAgain, Stan ignored his inquiry and looked at the now red-hot glow of the crucible. Without turning to face his friend, Stan spoke again.\n\n\"Lee, would you die for me?\"\n\nLee stood petrified, his blood rushing from his face. He sputtered a few words.\n\n\"I- wh-? Wh- no! No no no! *What the shit man?!*\"\n\nStan was taken aback by this, apparently believing his former friend would give up his life to help him.\n\n\"Please Lee, it'll only be a moment! I'll be with you the whole time!\"\n\nLee fought with his legs and struggled to get his ass out, but his limbs remained paralyzed by fear and shock. \n\n\"You're sick man!\"\n\n\"It'll be fine! I'll be with you the whole time! Just a few minutes in the mold!\"\n\n\"And what the fuck are you trying to accomplish by that?!\"\n\n\"Well, the copper will incinerate our tissues, but we will be integrated into the block and forever immortalized in metal!\"\n\n\"But why?!\"\n\n\"So we can be a famous director! So we can be a new Stan-Lee Cu-Brick!\"\n", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421921939, "id": "2t9ys7"}, {"title": "How do you increase the cash that you have?", "selftext": "You fold the bills many times.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421916174, "id": "2t9t3o"}, {"title": "Why were ex-Apple employees having a financially difficult time?", "selftext": "They didn't have Jobs.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421915128, "id": "2t9rz5"}, {"title": "Why didn't anyone answer the cow's question?", "selftext": "Nobody herd him ask it.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421907913, "id": "2t9ixk"}, {"title": "Did you hear about the dead nudist?", "selftext": "Doctors say he died of exposure.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421906515, "id": "2t9gup"}, {"title": "Did you hear what a deaf kid yelled at another student?", "selftext": "Neither did he.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421901444, "id": "2t98j4"}, {"title": "What kind of bird hates Froot Loops?", "selftext": "Toucan't Sam.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421901324, "id": "2t98bn"}, {"title": "It would be unfortunate if your last name was cumcision...", "selftext": "More unfortunate if you got knighted.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421899818, "id": "2t95mc"}, {"title": "What did the depressed couch say?", "selftext": "I couldn't chair less", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421888973, "id": "2t8jz9"}, {"title": "What do you call a veterinarian who only cares for canine?", "selftext": "He's a dogtor!", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421887431, "id": "2t8gog"}, {"title": "What do homeless people in New Jersey call their friends and family?", "selftext": "Hobo-Kin", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421878865, "id": "2t7xw6"}, {"title": "Have you guys heard about ISIS?", "selftext": "Crazy bitch is trying to put chunks of her husband back together...", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421873544, "id": "2t7lqu"}, {"title": "What did the overly-enthusiastic plumber say to the toilet?", "selftext": "Im gunna plunge the shit out of you!", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421842345, "id": "2t5wkc"}, {"title": "What's gray and can't fly?", "selftext": "A parking lot.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421828853, "id": "2t5il6"}, {"title": "What is Roger Federers favorite type of hat?", "selftext": "a fedora", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421822334, "id": "2t5anf"}, {"title": "Did you know they speak Portuguese, not Spanish, in Brazil?", "selftext": "They must speak a Brazilian languages.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421820717, "id": "2t58bo"}, {"title": "What do rabbit economists worry about?", "selftext": "Hopportunity cost", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421803781, "id": "2t4bqx"}, {"title": "Did you hear about the boy who walked by his exam?", "selftext": "He passed his test.\n\n\nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421791696, "id": "2t3ksv"}, {"title": "What do you call the chess team who brags a lot in their mansion's empty living room?", "selftext": "Chess nuts boasting on an open foyer.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421774827, "id": "2t2hc8"}, {"title": "Why did the Jew convert to Christianity when she contracted gonorrhea?", "selftext": "She thought it was a disease of the gentiles.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421774178, "id": "2t2fuw"}, {"title": "A pirate has been murdered in London", "selftext": "The case will be passed to Scotland Yarrrrrd", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421772840, "id": "2t2czj"}, {"title": "What's orange and sounds like a parrot?", "selftext": "A carrot\n\nI stole this one from Alan Davies from QI.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421770630, "id": "2t28bf"}, {"title": "What do you call an amphibious Spanish stoner?", "selftext": "S\u00ed-weed", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1421770422, "id": "2t27w5"}, {"title": "What do you hang up on Do You Gotta Bae Christmas?", "selftext": "Or Nah-ments.

One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.\n\nCoincidentally the father drives up. \"How can I ever thank you sir?\" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. \"Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.\"\n\n\"Ah, well...\" stammers the tramp, \"... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" says the father, \"I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.\"\n\n\"No! No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n\nHe finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n\n\"Ahem, which holiday would sir like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n\n\"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n\"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n\n\"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n\"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n\"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n\n\"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n\"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n\"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n\"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n\n\"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n\n\"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n\n\"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n\"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n\nup and up...\n\nbelow him the ship grew smaller...\n\non and on...\n\npast a solitary albatross...\n\nand still higher...\n\ntill the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n\nand on still further...\n\n/ till the ocean grew dim...\n\nand the earth itself...\n\nbegan to shrink...\n\npast our moon...\n\nand on...\n\nand Mars...\n\nand on...\n\nhigher, and higher...\n\nthrough the asteroid belt...\n\nand on and on towards the diving board...\n\npast the outer planets, until...\n\non the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n\nhe reached the board.\n\nHe climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n\nand then...\n\nhe jumped.\n\nSlowly at first,\n\nbut speeding up,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\nspeeding past Pluto,\n\nand the other outer planets,\n\nthrough the asteroid belt,\n\npast Mars,\n\nand the moon,\n\nfaster,\n\nand faster,\n\nfaster - ever faster,\n\nand by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\npast the albatross,\n\ndouble-back somersault,\n\nand he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,\n\nhurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,\n\nDown on the ship the crew strained their necks,\n\n\"I CAN SEE HIM!\" yelled a passenger, \"LOOK!!!\"\n\nThe tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...\n\nNOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE WATER!\n\nSMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!\n\nDOWN!\n\nDOWN!\n\nTHROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!\n\nTHROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!\n\nAND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!\n\nSTILL DOWN...!\n\nDEEPER,\n\nDEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,\n\nTILL.........\n\nSMASH!\n\nInto the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.\n\nDesperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.\n\nUp and up, desperate, gasping...\n\nOut of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.\n\n\"HERO!\" \"WONDERFUL!\" \"AMAZING!\" \"GOOD SHOW THAT!\"\n\nAnd handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.\n\n\"Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.\"\n\nThe tramp blushed.\n\nThe captain went on, \"but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.\"\n\nAnd the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: \"Well you see...\n\nI'm a just poor tramp...\n\nso you must understand...\n\nI've been through many a hard ship in my life.\"\n", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1395773900, "id": "21cf3h"}, {"title": "When are we all the same nationality?", "selftext": "....when euro-peein!\n\nLmao swag\n\n\nEdit: Since no one liked my joke im killing myself.", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1395765809, "id": "21c0vg"}, {"title": "What do you call a late special needs kid?", "selftext": "Tardy", "domain": "self.3amjokes", "over_18": false, "created_utc": 1395759169, "id": "21bpvr"}, {"title": "My wife slashed open her thumb accidentally.

Partway through the delivery, unfortunately, the doctor delivers some bad news: their otherwise perfectly healthy baby boy was born with just a head. No arms, no legs, no torso, just a head. \n\nThe father is devastated. All of his dreams of taking his son hiking, teaching him sports, and giving him a normal, happy life have been shattered. But he decides to still love the boy and do everything he can to give him a good life. \n\nThe boy begins to grow up, and in spite of the difficulties of having no torso or appendages, he lives a relatively normal life.  He makes it through school and graduates. He even gets into a decent university. Then he hits his 21st birthday. \n\nThe father of the boy decides to celebrate, and takes his son out to a bar for the first time.  \u201cBartender, how about a beer for my son here!\u201d he orders proudly. As he helps his son finish his very first beer, he is astonished to see a neck starting to grow out of the bottom of the boys head. \u201cHey bartender, hit me up with one more of those!\u201d he demands excitedly. As the boy finishes off his second beer, both he and the father are amazed to see that a torso has grown out of the bottom of the boy\u2019s neck.  Excitedly they order beer after beer, and from the boy\u2019s torso sprout perfectly healthy arms and legs. For the first time in his 21 years of life, he has a whole body.\n\n He tries out his new arms and hands, waving them around and clapping. He stands up to test out his new legs. Although a bit wobbly from the alcohol, he is able to stumble around reasonably well. The father is brimming with joy and excitement as he watches his son hobble around the bar. Smiling, the boy shuffles out the front door of the bar and into the street, and right then a speeding bus smashes into him, killing the boy on impact. The father is shocked and speechless.
